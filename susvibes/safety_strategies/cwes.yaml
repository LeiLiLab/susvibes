  description: A Web application must define a default error page for 4xx errors (e.g.
    404), 5xx (e.g. 500) errors and catch java.lang.Throwable exceptions to prevent
    attackers from mining information from the application container's built-in error
    response. When an attacker explores a web site looking for vulnerabilities, the
    amount of information that the site provides is crucial to the eventual success
    or failure of any attempted attacks.

  name: Improper Input Validation
  description: 'Input validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially
    dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within
    the code, or when communicating with other components. Input can consist of: raw
    data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc. metadata - information
    about the raw data, such as headers or size Data can be simple or structured.
    Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations
    of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data. Many properties
    of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such
    as: specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number
    of operations, time, etc. implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size
    of a file instead of a specified size indexes, offsets, or positions into more
    complex data structures symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative
    arrays, etc. well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected
    syntax lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as
    a token specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the
    input appears to be) consistency - between individual data elements, between raw
    data and metadata, between references, etc. conformance to domain-specific rules,
    e.g. business logic equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated
    the same authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g.
    a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data Implied or derived properties
    of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving
    properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation.'

CWE-22:
  name: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
  description: Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted
    directory. By using special elements such as .. and / separators, attackers can
    escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that
    are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the ../
    sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent
    directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal.
    Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as /usr/local/bin
    to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.

  description: This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or
    directories that are outside of the restricted directory. The ../ manipulation
    is the canonical manipulation for operating systems that use / as directory separators,

    manipulation is useful for bypassing some path traversal protection schemes. Sometimes
    a program only removes one ../ sequence, so multiple ../ can bypass that check.
    Alternately, this manipulation could be used to bypass a check for ../ at the
    beginning of the pathname, moving up more than one directory level.

    is useful for bypassing some path traversal protection schemes. On some Windows
    systems, it is equivalent to .... and might bypass checks that assume only two

  description: This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or
    directories that are outside of the restricted directory. The '....//' manipulation
    is useful for bypassing some path traversal protection schemes. If ../ is filtered
    in a sequential fashion, as done by some regular expression engines, then ....//
    can collapse into the ../ unsafe value (CWE-182). It could also be useful when

  name: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
    Component ('Injection')
  description: Software or other automated logic has certain assumptions about what
    constitutes data and control respectively. It is the lack of verification of these
    assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection
    problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different
    ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process.
    For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note
    the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important
    issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e.,
    they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data
    plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending
    code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer
    overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain
    execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.

    slash (/) to prevent absolute path names, but does not account for a tilde (~)
    followed by a user name, which on some *nix systems could be expanded to an absolute
    pathname. Alternately, the product might filter a dangerous -e command-line switch
    when calling an external program, but it might not account for --exec or other

  name: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')
  description: Many protocols and products have their own custom command language.

    attacks.
  id: CWE-77
CWE-78:
  name: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
    Injection')
  description: 'This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which
    the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web
    applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it
    could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible,
    or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have.
    The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle
    of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special
    system privileges that increases the amount of damage. There are at least two
    subtypes of OS command injection: The application intends to execute a single,
    fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied
    inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(nslookup
    [HOSTNAME]) to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is
    used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However,
    if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument,
    attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to
    execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing. The application
    accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as
    which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to
    the operating system. For example, the program might use exec([COMMAND]) to execute
    the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker
    control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the
    command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the
    attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.
    From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors.
    In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted
    parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second
    variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any
    untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways
    in which malicious attackers can provide input.'

  name: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')
  description: When creating commands using interpolation into a string, developers
    may assume that only the arguments/options that they specify will be processed.
    This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command
    in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g.
    in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer
    may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments
    when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that
    contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have
    more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to
    change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by
    the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.

CWE-113:
  name: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response
    Splitting')
  description: 'HTTP agents or components may include a web server, load balancer,
    reverse proxy, web caching proxy, application firewall, web browser, etc. Regardless
    of the role, they are expected to maintain coherent, consistent HTTP communication
    state across all components. However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header
    allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered
    by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web
    server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. When an HTTP
    request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with
    an output stream that is interpreted as splitting the stream into two different
    HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or r, and
    LF is line feed, also given by %0a or n. In addition to CR and LF characters,
    other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can
    be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or t) and SP (space,
    also given as + sign or %20). These types of unvalidated and unexpected data in
    HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second split message to
    mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache
    poisoning attacks. HTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when: Data
    enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP

CWE-116:
  name: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
  description: Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands
    that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead. Most
    products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication
    between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can
    contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example,
    GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 is a structured message containing a command (GET) with
    a single argument (/index.html) and metadata about which protocol version is being
    used (HTTP/1.1). If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct
    a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker
    could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as
    control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the
    output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

    result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be
    linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

CWE-120:
  name: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')
  description: A buffer overflow condition exists when a product attempts to put more
    data in a buffer than it can hold, or when it attempts to put data in a memory
    area outside of the boundaries of a buffer. The simplest type of error, and the
    most common cause of buffer overflows, is the classic case in which the product
    copies the buffer without restricting how much is copied. Other variants exist,
    but the existence of a classic overflow strongly suggests that the programmer
    is not considering even the most basic of security protections.

CWE-130:
  name: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency
  description: If an attacker can manipulate the length parameter associated with
    an input such that it is inconsistent with the actual length of the input, this
    can be leveraged to cause the target application to behave in unexpected, and
    possibly, malicious ways. One of the possible motives for doing so is to pass
    in arbitrarily large input to the application. Another possible motivation is
    the modification of application state by including invalid data for subsequent
    properties of the application. Such weaknesses commonly lead to attacks such as
    buffer overflows and execution of arbitrary code.

    off-by-one error could cause a null to be written out of bounds, leading to an
    overflow. Or, a program could use a strncpy() function call incorrectly, which
    prevents a null terminator from being added at all. Other scenarios are possible.

    space, making brute force attacks easier bypassing filters or access controls
    using alternate names multiple interpretation errors using alternate names.'
  id: CWE-178
CWE-179:
  name: 'Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Validation'
  description: Product needs to validate data at the proper time, after data has been
    canonicalized and cleansed. Early validation is susceptible to various manipulations
    that result in dangerous inputs that are produced by canonicalization and cleansing.
  id: CWE-179
CWE-180:

  name: Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value
  description: The product filters data in a way that causes it to be reduced or collapsed
    into an unsafe value that violates an expected security property.
  id: CWE-182
CWE-183:
  name: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs
  description: The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list
    of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because
    the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it
    allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.
  id: CWE-183
CWE-184:
  name: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
  description: The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list
    of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise
    require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but
    the list is incomplete.
  id: CWE-184
CWE-185:
  name: Incorrect Regular Expression
  description: When the regular expression is used in protection mechanisms such as
    filtering or validation, this may allow an attacker to bypass the intended restrictions
    on the incoming data.
  id: CWE-185
CWE-186:
  name: Overly Restrictive Regular Expression
  description: This weakness is not about regular expression complexity. Rather, it
    is about a regular expression that does not match all values that are intended.
    Consider the use of a regexp to identify acceptable values or to spot unwanted
    terms. An overly restrictive regexp misses some potentially security-relevant
    values leading to either false positives *or* false negatives, depending on how
    the regexp is being used within the code. Consider the expression /[0-8]/ where
    the intention was /[0-9]/. This expression is not complex but the value 9 is not
    matched when maybe the programmer planned to check for it.
  id: CWE-186
CWE-187:
  name: Partial String Comparison
  description: For example, an attacker might succeed in authentication by providing
    a small password that matches the associated portion of the larger, correct password.
  id: CWE-187
CWE-188:
  name: Reliance on Data/Memory Layout
  description: When changing platforms or protocol versions, in-memory organization
    of data may change in unintended ways. For example, some architectures may place
    local variables A and B right next to each other with A on top; some may place
    them next to each other with B on top; and others may add some padding to each.
    The padding size may vary to ensure that each variable is aligned to a proper
    word size. In protocol implementations, it is common to calculate an offset relative
    to another field to pick out a specific piece of data. Exceptional conditions,
    often involving new protocol versions, may add corner cases that change the data
    layout in an unusual way. The result can be that an implementation accesses an
    unintended field in the packet, treating data of one type as data of another type.
  id: CWE-188
CWE-190:
  name: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
  description: The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow
    or wraparound when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger
    than the original value. This occurs when an integer value is incremented to a
    value that is too large to store in the associated representation. When this occurs,
    the value may become a very small or negative number.
  id: CWE-190
CWE-191:
  name: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
  description: This can happen in signed and unsigned cases.
  id: CWE-191
CWE-192:
  name: Integer Coercion Error
  description: Several flaws fall under the category of integer coercion errors. For
    the most part, these errors in and of themselves result only in availability and
    data integrity issues. However, in some circumstances, they may result in other,
    more complicated security related flaws, such as buffer overflow conditions.
  id: CWE-192
CWE-193:
  name: Off-by-one Error
  description: A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value
    that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.
  id: CWE-193
CWE-194:
  name: Unexpected Sign Extension
  description: The product performs an operation on a number that causes it to be
    sign extended when it is transformed into a larger data type. When the original
    number is negative, this can produce unexpected values that lead to resultant
    weaknesses.
  id: CWE-194
CWE-195:
  name: Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error
  description: It is dangerous to rely on implicit casts between signed and unsigned
    numbers because the result can take on an unexpected value and violate assumptions
    made by the program. Often, functions will return negative values to indicate
    a failure. When the result of a function is to be used as a size parameter, using
    these negative return values can have unexpected results. For example, if negative
    size values are passed to the standard memory copy or allocation functions they
    will be implicitly cast to a large unsigned value. This may lead to an exploitable
    buffer overflow or underflow condition.
  id: CWE-195
CWE-196:
  name: Unsigned to Signed Conversion Error
  description: Although less frequent an issue than signed-to-unsigned conversion,
    unsigned-to-signed conversion can be the perfect precursor to dangerous buffer
    underwrite conditions that allow attackers to move down the stack where they otherwise
    might not have access in a normal buffer overflow condition. Buffer underwrites
    occur frequently when large unsigned values are cast to signed values, and then
    used as indexes into a buffer or for pointer arithmetic.
  id: CWE-196
CWE-197:
  name: Numeric Truncation Error
  description: When a primitive is cast to a smaller primitive, the high order bits
    of the large value are lost in the conversion, potentially resulting in an unexpected
    value that is not equal to the original value. This value may be required as an
    index into a buffer, a loop iterator, or simply necessary state data. In any case,
    the value cannot be trusted and the system will be in an undefined state. While
    this method may be employed viably to isolate the low bits of a value, this usage
    is rare, and truncation usually implies that an implementation error has occurred.
  id: CWE-197
CWE-198:
  name: Use of Incorrect Byte Ordering
  description: The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does
    not account for byte ordering (e.g. big-endian and little-endian) when processing
    the input, causing an incorrect number or value to be used.
  id: CWE-198
CWE-200:
  name: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
  description: 'There are many different kinds of mistakes that introduce information
    exposures. The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context
    in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed,
    and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information
    include: private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data,
    health records, geographic location, or contact details system status and environment,
    such as the operating system and installed packages business secrets and intellectual
    property network status and configuration the product''s own code or internal
    state metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers indirect information,
    such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by
    an outsider Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which
    may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected.
    These parties include: the product''s own users people or organizations whose
    information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product
    users the product''s administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or
    networks on which the product operates the developer Information exposures can
    occur in different ways: the code explicitly inserts sensitive information into
    resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors,
    but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been
    scrubbed or sanitized a different weakness or mistake indirectly inserts the sensitive
    information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system
    path of the program. the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive
    information, but the resources are unintentionally made accessible to unauthorized
    actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different
    weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place. It is common
    practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an information exposure, but
    this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective,
    loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different
    weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and
    its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors
    that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.'
  id: CWE-200
CWE-201:
  name: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
  description: The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data
    includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.
  id: CWE-201
CWE-202:
  name: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries
  description: In situations where data should not be tied to individual users, but
    a large number of users should be able to make queries that scrub the identity
    of users, it may be possible to get information about a user -- e.g., by specifying
    search terms that are known to be unique to that user.
  id: CWE-202
CWE-203:
  name: Observable Discrepancy
  description: Discrepancies can take many forms, and variations may be detectable
    in timing, control flow, communications such as replies or requests, or general
    behavior. These discrepancies can reveal information about the product's operation
    or internal state to an unauthorized actor. In some cases, discrepancies can be
    used by attackers to form a side channel.
  id: CWE-203
CWE-204:
  name: Observable Response Discrepancy
  description: The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a
    way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of
    the intended control sphere.
  id: CWE-204
CWE-205:
  name: Observable Behavioral Discrepancy
  description: Ideally, a product should provide as little information about its internal
    operations as possible. Otherwise, attackers could use knowledge of these internal
    operations to simplify or optimize their attack. In some cases, behavioral discrepancies
    can be used by attackers to form a side channel.
  id: CWE-205
CWE-206:
  name: Observable Internal Behavioral Discrepancy
  description: 'Ideally, a product should provide as little information as possible
    to an attacker. Any hints that the attacker may be making progress can then be
    used to simplify or optimize the attack. For example, in a login procedure that
    requires a username and password, ultimately there is only one decision: success
    or failure. However, internally, two separate actions are performed: determining
    if the username exists, and checking if the password is correct. If the product
    behaves differently based on whether the username exists or not, then the attacker
    only needs to concentrate on the password.'
  id: CWE-206
CWE-207:
  name: Observable Behavioral Discrepancy With Equivalent Products
  description: For many kinds of products, multiple products may be available that
    perform the same functionality, such as a web server, network interface, or intrusion
    detection system. Attackers often perform fingerprinting, which uses discrepancies
    in order to identify which specific product is in use. Once the specific product
    has been identified, the attacks can be made more customized and efficient. Often,
    an organization might intentionally allow the specific product to be identifiable.
    However, in some environments, the ability to identify a distinct product is unacceptable,
    and it is expected that every product would behave in exactly the same way. In
    these more restricted environments, a behavioral difference might pose an unacceptable
    risk if it makes it easier to identify the product's vendor, model, configuration,
    version, etc.
  id: CWE-207
CWE-208:
  name: Observable Timing Discrepancy
  description: In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can
    be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's
    internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers
    can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making
    the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.
  id: CWE-208
CWE-209:
  name: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
  description: 'The sensitive information may be valuable information on its own (such
    as a password), or it may be useful for launching other, more serious attacks.
    The error message may be created in different ways: self-generated: the source
    code explicitly constructs the error message and delivers it externally-generated:
    the external environment, such as a language interpreter, handles the error and
    constructs its own message, whose contents are not under direct control by the
    programmer An attacker may use the contents of error messages to help launch another,
    more focused attack. For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness
    (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn,
    this could be used to select the proper number of .. sequences to navigate to
    the targeted file. An attack using SQL injection (CWE-89) might not initially
    succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed query, which would expose
    query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information used within
    the query.'
  id: CWE-209
CWE-210:
  name: Self-generated Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
  description: The product identifies an error condition and creates its own diagnostic
    or error messages that contain sensitive information.
  id: CWE-210
CWE-211:
  name: Externally-Generated Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
  description: The product performs an operation that triggers an external diagnostic
    or error message that is not directly generated or controlled by the product,
    such as an error generated by the programming language interpreter that a software
    application uses. The error can contain sensitive system information.
  id: CWE-211
CWE-212:
  name: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
  description: Resources that may contain sensitive data include documents, packets,
    messages, databases, etc. While this data may be useful to an individual user
    or small set of users who share the resource, it may need to be removed before
    the resource can be shared outside of the trusted group. The process of removal
    is sometimes called cleansing or scrubbing. For example, a product for editing
    documents might not remove sensitive data such as reviewer comments or the local
    pathname where the document is stored. Or, a proxy might not remove an internal
    IP address from headers before making an outgoing request to an Internet site.
  id: CWE-212
CWE-213:
  name: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies
  description: When handling information, the developer must consider whether the
    information is regarded as sensitive by different stakeholders, such as users
    or administrators. Each stakeholder effectively has its own intended security
    policy that the product is expected to uphold. When a developer does not treat
    that information as sensitive, this can introduce a vulnerability that violates
    the expectations of the product's users.
  id: CWE-213
CWE-214:
  name: Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information
  description: Many operating systems allow a user to list information about processes
    that are owned by other users. Other users could see information such as command
    line arguments or environment variable settings. When this data contains sensitive
    information such as credentials, it might allow other users to launch an attack
    against the product or related resources.
  id: CWE-214
CWE-215:
  name: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Debugging Code
  description: When debugging, it may be necessary to report detailed information
    to the programmer. However, if the debugging code is not disabled when the product
    is operating in a production environment, then this sensitive information may
    be exposed to attackers.
  id: CWE-215

  name: 'DEPRECATED: Containment Errors (Container Errors)'
  description: This entry has been deprecated, as it was not effective as a weakness

  description: Besides public-facing web pages and code, products may store sensitive
    data, code that is not directly invoked, or other files under the web document
    root of the web server. If the server is not configured or otherwise used to prevent
    direct access to those files, then attackers may obtain this sensitive data.

  name: 'DEPRECATED: General Information Management Problems'
  description: This weakness can be found at CWE-199.
  id: CWE-225
CWE-226:
  name: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
  description: When resources are released, they can be made available for reuse.
    For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory
    available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is
    deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating
    systems do not usually clear the previously written information. Even when the
    resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data
    is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available.
    Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable
    but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use,
    the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.
    This weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches
    between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution
    changes to different users or privilege levels.

CWE-242:
  name: Use of Inherently Dangerous Function
  description: Certain functions behave in dangerous ways regardless of how they are
    used. Functions in this category were often implemented without taking security
    concerns into account. The gets() function is unsafe because it does not perform
    bounds checking on the size of its input. An attacker can easily send arbitrarily-sized
    input to gets() and overflow the destination buffer. Similarly, the >> operator
    is unsafe to use when reading into a statically-allocated character array because
    it does not perform bounds checking on the size of its input. An attacker can
    easily send arbitrarily-sized input to the >> operator and overflow the destination
    buffer.

    of the chroot jail after chroot() has been called.
  id: CWE-243
CWE-244:
  name: Improper Clearing of Heap Memory Before Release ('Heap Inspection')
  description: When sensitive data such as a password or an encryption key is not
    removed from memory, it could be exposed to an attacker using a heap inspection
    attack that reads the sensitive data using memory dumps or other methods. The
    realloc() function is commonly used to increase the size of a block of allocated
    memory. This operation often requires copying the contents of the old memory block
    into a new and larger block. This operation leaves the contents of the original
    block intact but inaccessible to the program, preventing the program from being
    able to scrub sensitive data from memory. If an attacker can later examine the
    contents of a memory dump, the sensitive data could be exposed.
  id: CWE-244
CWE-245:
  name: 'J2EE Bad Practices: Direct Management of Connections'
  description: The J2EE standard forbids the direct management of connections. It
    requires that applications use the container's resource management facilities
    to obtain connections to resources. Every major web application container provides
    pooled database connection management as part of its resource management framework.
    Duplicating this functionality in an application is difficult and error prone,
    which is part of the reason it is forbidden under the J2EE standard.

  description: The J2EE standard permits the use of sockets only for the purpose of
    communication with legacy systems when no higher-level protocol is available.
    Authoring your own communication protocol requires wrestling with difficult security
    issues. Without significant scrutiny by a security expert, chances are good that
    a custom communication protocol will suffer from security problems. Many of the
    same issues apply to a custom implementation of a standard protocol. While there
    are usually more resources available that address security concerns related to
    implementing a standard protocol, these resources are also available to attackers.

  description: 'This entry was deprecated for several reasons. The primary reason
    is over-loading of the path manipulation term and the description. The original
    description for this entry was the same as that for the Often Misused: File System
    item in the original Seven Pernicious Kingdoms paper. However, Seven Pernicious
    Kingdoms also has a Path Manipulation phrase that is for external control of pathnames
    (CWE-73), which is a factor in symbolic link following and path traversal, neither
    of which is explicitly mentioned in 7PK. Fortify uses the phrase Often Misused:
    Path Manipulation for a broader range of problems, generally for issues related
    to buffer management. Given the multiple conflicting uses of this term, there
    is a chance that CWE users may have incorrectly mapped to this entry. The second
    reason for deprecation is an implied combination of multiple weaknesses within
    buffer-handling functions. The focus of this entry was generally on the path-conversion
    functions and their association with buffer overflows. However, some of Fortify''s
    Vulncat entries have the term path manipulation but describe a non-overflow weakness
    in which the buffer is not guaranteed to contain the entire pathname, i.e., there
    is information truncation (see CWE-222 for a similar concept). A new entry for
    this non-overflow weakness may be created in a future version of CWE.'

CWE-250:
  name: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges
  description: New weaknesses can be exposed because running with extra privileges,
    such as root or Administrator, can disable the normal security checks being performed
    by the operating system or surrounding environment. Other pre-existing weaknesses
    can turn into security vulnerabilities if they occur while operating at raised
    privileges. Privilege management functions can behave in some less-than-obvious
    ways, and they have different quirks on different platforms. These inconsistencies
    are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to
    another. Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning
    process, so if a process is running as root when a signal fires or a sub-process
    is executed, the signal handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges.
  id: CWE-250
CWE-252:
  name: Unchecked Return Value
  description: Two common programmer assumptions are this function call can never
    fail and it doesn't matter if this function call fails. If an attacker can force
    the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the
    subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is
    not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls
    a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that
    privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate
    with the higher privileges.
  id: CWE-252
CWE-253:
  name: Incorrect Check of Function Return Value
  description: Important and common functions will return some value about the success
    of its actions. This will alert the program whether or not to handle any errors
    caused by that function.
  id: CWE-253
CWE-256:
  name: Plaintext Storage of a Password
  description: Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext
    in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext
    password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to
    the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext
    password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared
    immediately after it is used.
  id: CWE-256
CWE-257:
  name: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format
  description: The storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject
    to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that
    recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext
    passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but
    also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly,
    or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can
    use the password on other accounts.
  id: CWE-257

  name: Use of Hard-coded Password
  description: 'There are two main variations of a hard-coded password: Inbound: the
    product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.
    Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains
    a hard-coded password for connecting to that component.'
  id: CWE-259
CWE-260:
  name: Password in Configuration File
  description: This can result in compromise of the system for which the password
    is used. An attacker could gain access to this file and learn the stored password
    or worse yet, change the password to one of their choosing.
  id: CWE-260
CWE-261:
  name: Weak Encoding for Password
  description: Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext
    in an application's properties or configuration file. A programmer can attempt
    to remedy the password management problem by obscuring the password with an encoding
    function, such as base 64 encoding, but this effort does not adequately protect
    the password.
  id: CWE-261
CWE-262:
  name: Not Using Password Aging
  description: Password aging (or password rotation) is a policy that forces users
    to change their passwords after a defined time period passes, such as every 30
    or 90 days. Without mechanisms such as aging, users might not change their passwords
    in a timely manner. Note that while password aging was once considered an important
    security feature, it has since fallen out of favor by many, because it is not
    as effective against modern threats compared to other mechanisms such as slow
    hashes. In addition, forcing frequent changes can unintentionally encourage users
    to select less-secure passwords. However, password aging is still in use due to
    factors such as compliance requirements, e.g., Payment Card Industry Data Security
    Standard (PCI DSS).
  id: CWE-262
CWE-263:
  name: Password Aging with Long Expiration
  description: Password aging (or password rotation) is a policy that forces users
    to change their passwords after a defined time period passes, such as every 30
    or 90 days. A long expiration provides more time for attackers to conduct password
    cracking before users are forced to change to a new password. Note that while
    password aging was once considered an important security feature, it has since
    fallen out of favor by many, because it is not as effective against modern threats
    compared to other mechanisms such as slow hashes. In addition, forcing frequent
    changes can unintentionally encourage users to select less-secure passwords. However,
    password aging is still in use due to factors such as compliance requirements,
    e.g., Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

CWE-271:
  name: Privilege Dropping / Lowering Errors
  description: In some contexts, a system executing with elevated permissions will
    hand off a process/file/etc. to another process or user. If the privileges of
    an entity are not reduced, then elevated privileges are spread throughout a system
    and possibly to an attacker.

CWE-280:
  name: 'Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges '
  description: The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient

    This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in
    an invalid state.
  id: CWE-280
CWE-281:
  name: Improper Preservation of Permissions
  description: The product does not preserve permissions or incorrectly preserves
    permissions when copying, restoring, or sharing objects, which can cause them

  description: The product does not properly verify that a critical resource is owned
    by the proper entity.
  id: CWE-283
CWE-284:
  name: Improper Access Control
  description: 'Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such
    as: Authentication (proving the identity of an actor) Authorization (ensuring
    that a given actor can access a resource), and Accountability (tracking of activities
    that were performed) When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers
    can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive
    information, executing commands, evading detection, etc. There are two distinct
    behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses: Specification: incorrect
    privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the
    user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable,
    or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed
    by the program or the administrator. Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors
    that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements
    (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect
    ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself,
    in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator
    specifies.'
  id: CWE-284
CWE-285:
  name: Improper Authorization
  description: Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process
    of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's
    privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply
    to the resource. When access control checks are not applied consistently - or
    not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should
    not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including
    information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.

  description: The product performs authentication based on the name of a resource
    being accessed, or the name of the actor performing the access, but it does not
    properly check all possible names for that resource or actor.
  id: CWE-289
CWE-290:
  name: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing
  description: This attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication
    schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.
  id: CWE-290
CWE-291:
  name: Reliance on IP Address for Authentication
  description: IP addresses can be easily spoofed. Attackers can forge the source
    IP address of the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged
    IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic
    between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the
    required sniffing, attackers typically attempt to locate themselves on the same
    subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement
    by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet
    today. In summary, IP address verification can be a useful part of an authentication
    scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication.

    is not a valid means of message integrity checking.
  id: CWE-293
CWE-294:
  name: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
  description: Capture-replay attacks are common and can be difficult to defeat without
    cryptography. They are a subset of network injection attacks that rely on observing
    previously-sent valid commands, then changing them slightly if necessary and resending
    the same commands to the server.
  id: CWE-294
CWE-295:
  name: Improper Certificate Validation
  description: When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker
    to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the
    host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing
    it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed
    data that appears to originate from a trusted host.
  id: CWE-295
CWE-296:
  name: Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust
  description: 'If a system does not follow the chain of trust of a certificate to
    a root server, the certificate loses all usefulness as a metric of trust. Essentially,
    the trust gained from a certificate is derived from a chain of trust -- with a
    reputable trusted entity at the end of that list. The end user must trust that
    reputable source, and this reputable source must vouch for the resource in question
    through the medium of the certificate. In some cases, this trust traverses several
    entities who vouch for one another. The entity trusted by the end user is at one
    end of this trust chain, while the certificate-wielding resource is at the other
    end of the chain. If the user receives a certificate at the end of one of these
    trust chains and then proceeds to check only that the first link in the chain,
    no real trust has been derived, since the entire chain must be traversed back
    to a trusted source to verify the certificate. There are several ways in which
    the chain of trust might be broken, including but not limited to: Any certificate
    in the chain is self-signed, unless it the root. Not every intermediate certificate
    is checked, starting from the original certificate all the way up to the root
    certificate. An intermediate, CA-signed certificate does not have the expected
    Basic Constraints or other important extensions. The root certificate has been
    compromised or authorized to the wrong party.'
  id: CWE-296
CWE-297:
  name: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch
  description: Even if a certificate is well-formed, signed, and follows the chain
    of trust, it may simply be a valid certificate for a different site than the site
    that the product is interacting with. If the certificate's host-specific data
    is not properly checked - such as the Common Name (CN) in the Subject or the Subject
    Alternative Name (SAN) extension of an X.509 certificate - it may be possible
    for a redirection or spoofing attack to allow a malicious host with a valid certificate
    to provide data, impersonating a trusted host. In order to ensure data integrity,
    the certificate must be valid and it must pertain to the site that is being accessed.
    Even if the product attempts to check the hostname, it is still possible to incorrectly
    check the hostname. For example, attackers could create a certificate with a name
    that begins with a trusted name followed by a NUL byte, which could cause some
    string-based comparisons to only examine the portion that contains the trusted
    name. This weakness can occur even when the product uses Certificate Pinning,
    if the product does not verify the hostname at the time a certificate is pinned.
  id: CWE-297
CWE-298:
  name: Improper Validation of Certificate Expiration
  description: When the expiration of a certificate is not taken into account, no
    trust has necessarily been conveyed through it. Therefore, the validity of the
    certificate cannot be verified and all benefit of the certificate is lost.
  id: CWE-298
CWE-299:
  name: Improper Check for Certificate Revocation
  description: An improper check for certificate revocation is a far more serious
    flaw than related certificate failures. This is because the use of any revoked
    certificate is almost certainly malicious. The most common reason for certificate
    revocation is compromise of the system in question, with the result that no legitimate
    servers will be using a revoked certificate, unless they are sorely out of sync.
  id: CWE-299
CWE-300:
  name: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint
  description: In order to establish secure communication between two parties, it
    is often important to adequately verify the identity of entities at each end of
    the communication channel. Inadequate or inconsistent verification may result
    in insufficient or incorrect identification of either communicating entity. This
    can have negative consequences such as misplaced trust in the entity at the other
    end of the channel. An attacker can leverage this by interposing between the communicating
    entities and masquerading as the original entity. In the absence of sufficient
    verification of identity, such an attacker can eavesdrop and potentially modify
    the communication between the original entities.
  id: CWE-300
CWE-301:
  name: Reflection Attack in an Authentication Protocol
  description: A mutual authentication protocol requires each party to respond to
    a random challenge by the other party by encrypting it with a pre-shared key.
    Often, however, such protocols employ the same pre-shared key for communication
    with a number of different entities. A malicious user or an attacker can easily
    compromise this protocol without possessing the correct key by employing a reflection
    attack on the protocol. Reflection attacks capitalize on mutual authentication
    schemes in order to trick the target into revealing the secret shared between
    it and another valid user. In a basic mutual-authentication scheme, a secret is
    known to both the valid user and the server; this allows them to authenticate.
    In order that they may verify this shared secret without sending it plainly over
    the wire, they utilize a Diffie-Hellman-style scheme in which they each pick a
    value, then request the hash of that value as keyed by the shared secret. In a
    reflection attack, the attacker claims to be a valid user and requests the hash
    of a random value from the server. When the server returns this value and requests
    its own value to be hashed, the attacker opens another connection to the server.
    This time, the hash requested by the attacker is the value which the server requested
    in the first connection. When the server returns this hashed value, it is used
    in the first connection, authenticating the attacker successfully as the impersonated
    valid user.
  id: CWE-301

  id: CWE-307
CWE-308:
  name: Use of Single-factor Authentication
  description: While the use of multiple authentication schemes is simply piling on
    more complexity on top of authentication, it is inestimably valuable to have such
    measures of redundancy. The use of weak, reused, and common passwords is rampant
    on the internet. Without the added protection of multiple authentication schemes,
    a single mistake can result in the compromise of an account. For this reason,
    if multiple schemes are possible and also easy to use, they should be implemented
    and required.

  name: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in a Cookie
  description: Attackers can use widely-available tools to view the cookie and read

    not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being
    used, then decode the information.
  id: CWE-315
CWE-316:
  name: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory
  description: The sensitive memory might be saved to disk, stored in a core dump,
    or remain uncleared if the product crashes, or if the programmer does not properly
    clear the memory before freeing it. It could be argued that such problems are
    usually only exploitable by those with administrator privileges. However, swapping
    could cause the memory to be written to disk and leave it accessible to physical
    attack afterwards. Core dump files might have insecure permissions or be stored
    in archive files that are accessible to untrusted people. Or, uncleared sensitive
    memory might be inadvertently exposed to attackers due to another weakness.
  id: CWE-316
CWE-317:
  name: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI
  description: An attacker can often obtain data from a GUI, even if hidden, by using
    an API to directly access GUI objects such as windows and menus. Even if the information
    is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine
    which encoding is being used, then decode the information.
  id: CWE-317
CWE-318:
  name: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Executable
  description: Attackers can reverse engineer binary code to obtain secret data. This
    is especially easy when the cleartext is plain ASCII. Even if the information
    is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine
    which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

  description: The product uses a hard-coded, unchangeable cryptographic key.
  id: CWE-321
CWE-322:
  name: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication
  description: Performing a key exchange will preserve the integrity of the information
    sent between two entities, but this will not guarantee that the entities are who
    they claim they are. This may enable an attacker to impersonate an actor by modifying
    traffic between the two entities. Typically, this involves a victim client that
    contacts a malicious server that is impersonating a trusted server. If the client
    skips authentication or ignores an authentication failure, the malicious server
    may request authentication information from the user. The malicious server can
    then use this authentication information to log in to the trusted server using
    the victim's credentials, sniff traffic between the victim and trusted server,
    etc.

  id: CWE-326
CWE-327:
  name: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
  description: Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled
    to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography
    can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways,
    spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts. It is very difficult
    to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished
    cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or
    weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of
    well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products.
    Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined
    adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has
    been protected. Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common
    for an algorithm to be considered unsafe even if it was once thought to be strong.
    This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases
    so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection
    that was originally thought. For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more
    challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as
    opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented
    cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product,
    because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the
    hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power
    will only increase over time.

CWE-328:
  name: Use of Weak Hash
  description: 'A hash function is defined as an algorithm that maps arbitrarily sized
    data into a fixed-sized digest (output) such that the following properties hold:
    The algorithm is not invertible (also called one-way or not reversible) The algorithm
    is deterministic; the same input produces the same digest every time Building
    on this definition, a cryptographic hash function must also ensure that a malicious
    actor cannot leverage the hash function to have a reasonable chance of success
    at determining any of the following: the original input (preimage attack), given
    only the digest another input that can produce the same digest (2nd preimage attack),
    given the original input a set of two or more inputs that evaluate to the same
    digest (birthday attack), given the actor can arbitrarily choose the inputs to
    be hashed and can do so a reasonable amount of times What is regarded as reasonable
    varies by context and threat model, but in general, reasonable could cover any
    attack that is more efficient than brute force (i.e., on average, attempting half
    of all possible combinations). Note that some attacks might be more efficient
    than brute force but are still not regarded as achievable in the real world. Any
    algorithm that does not meet the above conditions will generally be considered
    weak for general use in hashing. In addition to algorithmic weaknesses, a hash
    function can be made weak by using the hash in a security context that breaks
    its security guarantees. For example, using a hash function without a salt for
    storing passwords (that are sufficiently short) could enable an adversary to create
    a rainbow table [REF-637] to recover the password under certain conditions; this
    attack works against such hash functions as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2.'

  name: Generation of Predictable IV with CBC Mode
  description: CBC mode eliminates a weakness of Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode by
    allowing identical plaintext blocks to be encrypted to different ciphertext blocks.
    This is possible by the XOR-ing of an IV with the initial plaintext block so that
    every plaintext block in the chain is XOR'd with a different value before encryption.
    If IVs are reused, then identical plaintexts would be encrypted to identical ciphertexts.
    However, even if IVs are not identical but are predictable, then they still break
    the security of CBC mode against Chosen Plaintext Attacks (CPA).

  name: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
  description: 'PRNGs are deterministic and, while their output appears random, they
    cannot actually create entropy. They rely on cryptographically secure and unique
    seeds for entropy so proper seeding is critical to the secure operation of the
    PRNG. Management of seeds could be broken down into two main areas: (1) protecting
    seeds as cryptographic material (such as a cryptographic key); (2) whenever possible,
    using a uniquely generated seed from a cryptographically secure source PRNGs require
    a seed as input to generate a stream of numbers that are functionally indistinguishable
    from random numbers. While the output is, in many cases, sufficient for cryptographic
    uses, the output of any PRNG is directly determined by the seed provided as input.
    If the seed can be ascertained by a third party, the entire output of the PRNG
    can be made known to them. As such, the seed should be kept secret and should
    ideally not be able to be guessed. For example, the current time may be a poor
    seed. Knowing the approximate time the PRNG was seeded greatly reduces the possible
    key space. Seeds do not necessarily need to be unique, but reusing seeds may open
    up attacks if the seed is discovered.'

  name: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
  description: When a non-cryptographic PRNG is used in a cryptographic context, it

    number generator (PRNG) is not designed for cryptography. Sometimes a mediocre
    source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random
    numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use
    the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have
    very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography.
  id: CWE-338
CWE-339:
  name: Small Seed Space in PRNG
  description: PRNGs are entirely deterministic once seeded, so it should be extremely
    difficult to guess the seed. If an attacker can collect the outputs of a PRNG
    and then brute force the seed by trying every possibility to see which seed matches
    the observed output, then the attacker will know the output of any subsequent
    calls to the PRNG. A small seed space implies that the attacker will have far
    fewer possible values to try to exhaust all possibilities.

  description: The output of a random number generator should not be predictable based
    on observations of previous values. In some cases, an attacker cannot predict
    the exact value that will be produced next, but can narrow down the possibilities
    significantly. This reduces the amount of effort to perform a brute force attack.
    For example, suppose the product generates random numbers between 1 and 100, but
    it always produces a larger value until it reaches 100. If the generator produces
    an 80, then the attacker knows that the next value will be somewhere between 81
    and 100. Instead of 100 possibilities, the attacker only needs to consider 20.

  description: Since DNS names can be easily spoofed or misreported, and it may be

    DNS names do not constitute a valid authentication mechanism. When the product
    performs a reverse DNS resolution for an IP address, if an attacker controls the
    DNS server for that IP address, then the attacker can cause the server to return
    an arbitrary hostname. As a result, the attacker may be able to bypass authentication,
    cause the wrong hostname to be recorded in log files to hide activities, or perform
    other attacks. Attackers can spoof DNS names by either (1) compromising a DNS
    server and modifying its records (sometimes called DNS cache poisoning), or (2)

  description: If integrity check values or checksums are omitted from a protocol,
    there is no way of determining if data has been corrupted in transmission. The
    lack of checksum functionality in a protocol removes the first application-level
    check of data that can be used. The end-to-end philosophy of checks states that
    integrity checks should be performed at the lowest level that they can be completely
    implemented. Excluding further sanity checks and input validation performed by
    applications, the protocol's checksum is the most important level of checksum,
    since it can be performed more completely than at any previous level and takes
    into account entire messages, as opposed to single packets.

CWE-362:
  name: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race
    Condition')
  description: 'A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is
    effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence
    may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series
    of program invocations, etc. A race condition violates these properties, which
    are closely related: Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access
    to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of
    the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution. Atomicity
    - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can
    concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the
    same resource. A race condition exists when an interfering code sequence can still
    access the shared resource, violating exclusivity. The interfering code sequence
    could be trusted or untrusted. A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within
    the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked
    indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by
    the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.'

  name: Race Condition Enabling Link Following
  description: While developers might expect that there is a very narrow time window
    between the time of check and time of use, there is still a race condition. An

    causing the time window to become larger. Alternately, in some situations, the
    attacker could win the race by performing a large number of attacks.
  id: CWE-363
CWE-364:
  name: Signal Handler Race Condition
  description: 'Race conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal
    handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of
    root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race
    condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial
    of service or even code execution. These issues occur when non-reentrant functions,
    or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called
    at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the regular
    code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked.
    If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant
    function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable
    for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free
    is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a
    write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has
    been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed
    and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal
    handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal
    handler itself may be reentered. There are several known behaviors related to
    signal handlers that have received the label of signal handler race condition:
    Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both
    a signal handler and regular code Shared state between a signal handler and other
    signal handlers Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which
    generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free()
    are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing
    memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog();
    these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.
    Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which
    might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For
    example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses. Use
    of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from
    returning control back to the original functionality While not technically a race
    condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being
    called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not
    any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free
    and use-after-free weaknesses. Signal handler vulnerabilities are often classified
    based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of
    classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of
    several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms
    may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity
    for the relevant code: Avoiding shared state Using synchronization in the signal
    handler Using synchronization in the regular code Disabling or masking other signals,
    which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)'

    is already covered by CWE-367. Despite the ambiguity in the documentation for
    some languages and compilers, in practice, they all evaluate the switch control

  name: Declaration of Throws for Generic Exception
  description: Declaring a method to throw Exception or Throwable promotes generic
    error handling procedures that make it difficult for callers to perform proper
    error handling and error recovery. For example, Java's exception mechanism makes
    it easy for callers to anticipate what can go wrong and write code to handle each
    specific exceptional circumstance. Declaring that a method throws a generic form
    of exception defeats this system.

    the product allows malicious users or attackers to consume more resources than
    their access level permits.
  id: CWE-405
CWE-406:
  name: Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume (Network Amplification)
  description: In the absence of a policy to restrict asymmetric resource consumption,
    the application or system cannot distinguish between legitimate transmissions
    and traffic intended to serve as an amplifying attack on target systems. Systems
    can often be configured to restrict the amount of traffic sent out on behalf of
    a client, based on the client's origin or access level. This is usually defined
    in a resource allocation policy. In the absence of a mechanism to keep track of
    transmissions, the system or application can be easily abused to transmit asymmetrically
    greater traffic than the request or client should be permitted to.

CWE-426:
  name: Untrusted Search Path
  description: 'This might allow attackers to execute their own programs, access unauthorized
    data files, or modify configuration in unexpected ways. If the product uses a
    search path to locate critical resources such as programs, then an attacker could
    modify that search path to point to a malicious program, which the targeted product
    would then execute. The problem extends to any type of critical resource that
    the product trusts. Some of the most common variants of untrusted search path
    are: In various UNIX and Linux-based systems, the PATH environment variable may
    be consulted to locate executable programs, and LD_PRELOAD may be used to locate
    a separate library. In various Microsoft-based systems, the PATH environment variable
    is consulted to locate a DLL, if the DLL is not found in other paths that appear
    earlier in the search order.'
  id: CWE-426
CWE-427:
  name: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
  description: 'Although this weakness can occur with any type of resource, it is
    frequently introduced when a product uses a directory search path to find executables
    or code libraries, but the path contains a directory that can be modified by an
    attacker, such as /tmp or the current working directory. In Windows-based systems,
    when the LoadLibrary or LoadLibraryEx function is called with a DLL name that
    does not contain a fully qualified path, the function follows a search order that
    includes two path elements that might be uncontrolled: the directory from which
    the program has been loaded the current working directory In some cases, the attack
    can be conducted remotely, such as when SMB or WebDAV network shares are used.
    One or more locations in that path could include the Windows drive root or its
    subdirectories. This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled
    nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code
    that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and
    some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them
    uncontrolled. In some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains
    an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty
    element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which
    might be an untrusted search element. In software package management frameworks
    (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party
    libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired
    package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository.
    This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public
    repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The
    search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the
    framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.'

CWE-441:
  name: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy')
  description: 'If an attacker cannot directly contact a target, but the product has
    access to the target, then the attacker can send a request to the product and
    have it be forwarded to the target. The request would appear to be coming from
    the product''s system, not the attacker''s system. As a result, the attacker can
    bypass access controls (such as firewalls) or hide the source of malicious requests,
    since the requests would not be coming directly from the attacker. Since proxy
    functionality and message-forwarding often serve a legitimate purpose, this issue
    only becomes a vulnerability when: The product runs with different privileges
    or on a different system, or otherwise has different levels of access than the
    upstream component; The attacker is prevented from making the request directly
    to the target; and The attacker can create a request that the proxy does not explicitly
    intend to be forwarded on the behalf of the requester. Such a request might point
    to an unexpected hostname, port number, hardware IP, or service. Or, the request

  id: CWE-443
CWE-444:
  name: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')
  description: HTTP requests or responses (messages) can be malformed or unexpected
    in ways that cause web servers or clients to interpret the messages in different
    ways than intermediary HTTP agents such as load balancers, reverse proxies, web
    caching proxies, application firewalls, etc. For example, an adversary may be
    able to add duplicate or different header fields that a client or server might
    interpret as one set of messages, whereas the intermediary might interpret the
    same sequence of bytes as a different set of messages. For example, discrepancies
    can arise in how to handle duplicate headers like two Transfer-encoding (TE) or
    two Content-length (CL), or the malicious HTTP message will have different headers
    for TE and CL. The inconsistent parsing and interpretation of messages can allow
    the adversary to smuggle a message to the client/server without the intermediary
    being aware of it. This weakness is usually the result of the usage of outdated
    or incompatible HTTP protocol versions in the HTTP agents.

CWE-451:
  name: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
  description: 'If an attacker can cause the UI to display erroneous data, or to otherwise
    convince the user to display information that appears to come from a trusted source,
    then the attacker could trick the user into performing the wrong action. This
    is often a component in phishing attacks, but other kinds of problems exist. For
    example, if the UI is used to monitor the security state of a system or network,
    then omitting or obscuring an important indicator could prevent the user from
    detecting and reacting to a security-critical event. UI misrepresentation can
    take many forms: Incorrect indicator: incorrect information is displayed, which
    prevents the user from understanding the true state of the product or the environment
    the product is monitoring, especially of potentially-dangerous conditions or operations.
    This can be broken down into several different subtypes. Overlay: an area of the
    display is intended to give critical information, but another process can modify
    the display by overlaying another element on top of it. The user is not interacting
    with the expected portion of the user interface. This is the problem that enables
    clickjacking attacks, although many other types of attacks exist that involve
    overlay. Icon manipulation: the wrong icon, or the wrong color indicator, can
    be influenced (such as making a dangerous .EXE executable look like a harmless
    .GIF) Timing: the product is performing a state transition or context switch that
    is presented to the user with an indicator, but a race condition can cause the
    wrong indicator to be used before the product has fully switched context. The
    race window could be extended indefinitely if the attacker can trigger an error.
    Visual truncation: important information could be truncated from the display,
    such as a long filename with a dangerous extension that is not displayed in the
    GUI because the malicious portion is truncated. The use of excessive whitespace
    can also cause truncation, or place the potentially-dangerous indicator outside
    of the user''s field of view (e.g. filename.txt .exe). A different type of truncation
    can occur when a portion of the information is removed due to reasons other than
    length, such as the accidental insertion of an end-of-input marker in the middle
    of an input, such as a NUL byte in a C-style string. Visual distinction: visual
    information might be presented in a way that makes it difficult for the user to
    quickly and correctly distinguish between critical and unimportant segments of
    the display. Homographs: letters from different character sets, fonts, or languages
    can appear very similar (i.e. may be visually equivalent) in a way that causes
    the human user to misread the text (for example, to conduct phishing attacks to
    trick a user into visiting a malicious web site with a visually-similar name as
    a trusted site). This can be regarded as a type of visual distinction issue.'

  description: If the product uses external inputs to determine which class to instantiate

    paths that were not intended by the developer. These paths could bypass authentication
    or access control checks, or otherwise cause the product to behave in an unexpected
    manner. This situation becomes a doomsday scenario if the attacker can upload
    files into a location that appears on the product's classpath (CWE-427) or add
    new entries to the product's classpath (CWE-426). Under either of these conditions,
    the attacker can use reflection to introduce new, malicious behavior into the

  name: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
  description: If a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values
    from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can
    lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make
    the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not
    susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable
    can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.
    For example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across
    sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions
    on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the
    cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges.
    This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the
    value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.

    in memory corruption. This can lead to an unexpected system state and unpredictable
    results with a variety of potential consequences depending on context, including
    denial of service and code execution. Many functions are not reentrant, but some
    of them can result in the corruption of memory if they are used in a signal handler.
    The function call syslog() is an example of this. In order to perform its functionality,
    it allocates a small amount of memory as scratch space. If syslog() is suspended
    by a signal call and the signal handler calls syslog(), the memory used by both
    of these functions enters an undefined, and possibly, exploitable state. Implementations
    of malloc() and free() manage metadata in global structures in order to track
    which memory is allocated versus which memory is available, but they are non-reentrant.
    Simultaneous calls to these functions can cause corruption of the metadata.

  name: Assigning instead of Comparing
  description: In many languages the compare statement is very close in appearance
    to the assignment statement and are often confused. This bug is generally the
    result of a typo and usually causes obvious problems with program execution. If
    the comparison is in an if statement, the if statement will usually evaluate the

  name: Incorrect Block Delimitation
  description: In some languages, braces (or other delimiters) are optional for blocks.
    When the delimiter is omitted, it is possible to insert a logic error in which
    a statement is thought to be in a block but is not. In some cases, the logic error
    can have security implications.

  name: Comparison of Classes by Name
  description: If the decision to trust the methods and data of an object is based
    on the name of a class, it is possible for malicious users to send objects of
    the same name as trusted classes and thereby gain the trust afforded to known
    classes and types.

    parts of a program. This is an ease-of-software-development feature but not a
    security feature.
  id: CWE-487
CWE-488:
  name: Exposure of Data Element to Wrong Session
  description: Data can bleed from one session to another through member variables
    of singleton objects, such as Servlets, and objects from a shared pool. In the
    case of Servlets, developers sometimes do not understand that, unless a Servlet
    implements the SingleThreadModel interface, the Servlet is a singleton; there
    is only one instance of the Servlet, and that single instance is used and re-used
    to handle multiple requests that are processed simultaneously by different threads.
    A common result is that developers use Servlet member fields in such a way that
    one user may inadvertently see another user's data. In other words, storing user
    data in Servlet member fields introduces a data access race condition.
  id: CWE-488
CWE-489:
  name: Active Debug Code
  description: A common development practice is to add back door code specifically
    designed for debugging or testing purposes that is not intended to be shipped
    or deployed with the product. These back door entry points create security risks
    because they are not considered during design or testing and fall outside of the
    expected operating conditions of the product.

    the object to be in an unexpected state.
  id: CWE-491
CWE-492:
  name: Use of Inner Class Containing Sensitive Data
  description: Inner classes quietly introduce several security concerns because of
    the way they are translated into Java bytecode. In Java source code, it appears
    that an inner class can be declared to be accessible only by the enclosing class,
    but Java bytecode has no concept of an inner class, so the compiler must transform
    an inner class declaration into a peer class with package level access to the
    original outer class. More insidiously, since an inner class can access private
    fields in its enclosing class, once an inner class becomes a peer class in bytecode,
    the compiler converts private fields accessed by the inner class into protected
    fields.
  id: CWE-492
CWE-493:
  name: Critical Public Variable Without Final Modifier
  description: If a field is non-final and public, it can be changed once the value
    is set by any function that has access to the class which contains the field.
    This could lead to a vulnerability if other parts of the program make assumptions
    about the contents of that field.

CWE-497:
  name: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
  description: Network-based products, such as web applications, often run on top
    of an operating system or similar environment. When the product communicates with
    outside parties, details about the underlying system are expected to remain hidden,
    such as path names for data files, other OS users, installed packages, the application
    environment, etc. This system information may be provided by the product itself,
    or buried within diagnostic or debugging messages. Debugging information helps
    an adversary learn about the system and form an attack plan. An information exposure
    occurs when system data or debugging information leaves the program through an
    output stream or logging function that makes it accessible to unauthorized parties.
    Using other weaknesses, an attacker could cause errors to occur; the response
    to these errors can reveal detailed system information, along with other impacts.
    An attacker can use messages that reveal technologies, operating systems, and
    product versions to tune the attack against known vulnerabilities in these technologies.
    A product may use diagnostic methods that provide significant implementation details
    such as stack traces as part of its error handling mechanism.

CWE-501:
  name: Trust Boundary Violation
  description: A trust boundary can be thought of as line drawn through a program.
    On one side of the line, data is untrusted. On the other side of the line, data
    is assumed to be trustworthy. The purpose of validation logic is to allow data
    to safely cross the trust boundary - to move from untrusted to trusted. A trust
    boundary violation occurs when a program blurs the line between what is trusted
    and what is untrusted. By combining trusted and untrusted data in the same data
    structure, it becomes easier for programmers to mistakenly trust unvalidated data.

    In general, it is meant to refer to products that collect information or install
    functionality that human users might not allow if they were fully aware of the
    actions being taken by the software. For example, a user might expect that tax
    software would collect a social security number and include it when filing a tax
    return, but that same user would not expect gaming software to obtain the social
    security number from that tax software's data.

  name: Covert Storage Channel
  description: Covert storage channels occur when out-of-band data is stored in messages
    for the purpose of memory reuse. Covert channels are frequently classified as
    either storage or timing channels. Examples would include using a file intended
    to hold only audit information to convey user passwords--using the name of a file
    or perhaps status bits associated with it that can be read by all users to signal
    the contents of the file. Steganography, concealing information in such a manner
    that no one but the intended recipient knows of the existence of the message,
    is a good example of a covert storage channel.

CWE-520:
  name: '.NET Misconfiguration: Use of Impersonation'
  description: .NET server applications can optionally execute using the identity
    of the user authenticated to the client. The intention of this functionality is
    to bypass authentication and access control checks within the .NET application
    code. Authentication is done by the underlying web server (Microsoft Internet
    Information Service IIS), which passes the authenticated token, or unauthenticated
    anonymous token, to the .NET application. Using the token to impersonate the client,
    the application then relies on the settings within the NTFS directories and files
    to control access. Impersonation enables the application, on the server running
    the .NET application, to both execute code and access resources in the context
    of the authenticated and authorized user.
  id: CWE-520
CWE-521:
  name: Weak Password Requirements
  description: Authentication mechanisms often rely on a memorized secret (also known
    as a password) to provide an assertion of identity for a user of a system. It
    is therefore important that this password be of sufficient complexity and impractical
    for an adversary to guess. The specific requirements around how complex a password
    needs to be depends on the type of system being protected. Selecting the correct
    password requirements and enforcing them through implementation are critical to
    the overall success of the authentication mechanism.

  name: Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information
  description: Applications may use caches to improve efficiency when communicating
    with remote entities or performing intensive calculations. A cache maintains a
    pool of objects, threads, connections, pages, financial data, passwords, or other
    resources to minimize the time it takes to initialize and access these resources.
    If the cache is accessible to unauthorized actors, attackers can read the cache
    and obtain this sensitive information.

CWE-526:
  name: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in an Environment Variable
  description: Information stored in an environment variable can be accessible by
    other processes with the execution context, including child processes that dependencies
    are executed in, or serverless functions in cloud environments. An environment
    variable's contents can also be inserted into messages, headers, log files, or
    other outputs. Often these other dependencies have no need to use the environment
    variable in question. A weakness that discloses environment variables could expose
    this information.

  name: Exposure of Version-Control Repository to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
  description: Version control repositories such as CVS or git store version-specific
    metadata and other details within subdirectories. If these subdirectories are
    stored on a web server or added to an archive, then these could be used by an
    attacker. This information may include usernames, filenames, path root, IP addresses,
    and detailed diff data about how files have been changed - which could reveal
    source code snippets that were never intended to be made public.

    an attack can be launched.
  id: CWE-529
CWE-530:
  name: Exposure of Backup File to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
  description: Often, older backup files are renamed with an extension such as .~bk

  name: Use of Persistent Cookies Containing Sensitive Information
  description: 'Cookies are small bits of data that are sent by the web application
    but stored locally in the browser. This lets the application use the cookie to
    pass information between pages and store variable information. The web application
    controls what information is stored in a cookie and how it is used. Typical types
    of information stored in cookies are session identifiers, personalization and
    customization information, and in rare cases even usernames to enable automated
    logins. There are two different types of cookies: session cookies and persistent
    cookies. Session cookies just live in the browser''s memory and are not stored
    anywhere, but persistent cookies are stored on the browser''s hard drive. This
    can cause security and privacy issues depending on the information stored in the

CWE-552:
  name: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
  description: Web servers, FTP servers, and similar servers may store a set of files
    underneath a root directory that is accessible to the server's users. Applications
    may store sensitive files underneath this root without also using access control
    to limit which users may request those files, if any. Alternately, an application
    might package multiple files or directories into an archive file (e.g., ZIP or
    tar), but the application might not exclude sensitive files that are underneath
    those directories. In cloud technologies and containers, this weakness might present
    itself in the form of misconfigured storage accounts that can be read or written
    by a public or anonymous user.

  name: Use of getlogin() in Multithreaded Application
  description: The getlogin() function returns a pointer to a string that contains
    the name of the user associated with the calling process. The function is not
    reentrant, meaning that if it is called from another process, the contents are
    not locked out and the value of the string can be changed by another process.
    This makes it very risky to use because the username can be changed by other processes,
    so the results of the function cannot be trusted.

CWE-562:
  name: Return of Stack Variable Address
  description: Because local variables are allocated on the stack, when a program
    returns a pointer to a local variable, it is returning a stack address. A subsequent
    function call is likely to re-use this same stack address, thereby overwriting
    the value of the pointer, which no longer corresponds to the same variable since
    a function's stack frame is invalidated when it returns. At best this will cause
    the value of the pointer to change unexpectedly. In many cases it causes the program
    to crash the next time the pointer is dereferenced.

  name: Unsynchronized Access to Shared Data in a Multithreaded Context
  description: Within servlets, shared static variables are not protected from concurrent
    access, but servlets are multithreaded. This is a typical programming mistake
    in J2EE applications, since the multithreading is handled by the framework. When
    a shared variable can be influenced by an attacker, one thread could wind up modifying
    the variable to contain data that is not valid for a different thread that is
    also using the data within the variable. Note that this weakness is not unique
    to servlets.

  name: Call to Thread run() instead of start()
  description: In most cases a direct call to a Thread object's run() method is a
    bug. The programmer intended to begin a new thread of control, but accidentally
    called run() instead of start(), so the run() method will execute in the caller's
    thread of control.

    portable and behave consistently in any EJB container. In this case, the product
    violates the following EJB guideline: An enterprise bean must not use thread synchronization
    primitives to synchronize execution of multiple instances. The specification justifies
    this requirement in the following way: This rule is required to ensure consistent

  description: A J2EE application can make use of multiple JVMs in order to improve
    application reliability and performance. In order to make the multiple JVMs appear
    as a single application to the end user, the J2EE container can replicate an HttpSession
    object across multiple JVMs so that if one JVM becomes unavailable another can

CWE-582:
  name: Array Declared Public, Final, and Static
  description: Because arrays are mutable objects, the final constraint requires that
    the array object itself be assigned only once, but makes no guarantees about the
    values of the array elements. Since the array is public, a malicious program can
    change the values stored in the array. As such, in most cases an array declared

CWE-591:
  name: Sensitive Data Storage in Improperly Locked Memory
  description: On Windows systems the VirtualLock function can lock a page of memory
    to ensure that it will remain present in memory and not be swapped to disk. However,
    on older versions of Windows, such as 95, 98, or Me, the VirtualLock() function
    is only a stub and provides no protection. On POSIX systems the mlock() call ensures
    that a page will stay resident in memory but does not guarantee that the page
    will not appear in the swap. Therefore, it is unsuitable for use as a protection
    mechanism for sensitive data. Some platforms, in particular Linux, do make the
    guarantee that the page will not be swapped, but this is non-standard and is not
    portable. Calls to mlock() also require supervisor privilege. Return values for
    both of these calls must be checked to ensure that the lock operation was actually
    successful.

CWE-594:
  name: 'J2EE Framework: Saving Unserializable Objects to Disk'
  description: In heavy load conditions, most J2EE application frameworks flush objects
    to disk to manage memory requirements of incoming requests. For example, session
    scoped objects, and even application scoped objects, are written to disk when
    required. While these application frameworks do the real work of writing objects
    to disk, they do not enforce that those objects be serializable, thus leaving
    the web application vulnerable to crashes induced by serialization failure. An
    attacker may be able to mount a denial of service attack by sending enough requests
    to the server to force the web application to save objects to disk.
  id: CWE-594
CWE-595:
  name: Comparison of Object References Instead of Object Contents
  description: For example, in Java, comparing objects using == usually produces deceptive
    results, since the == operator compares object references rather than values;
    often, this means that using == for strings is actually comparing the strings'
    references, not their values.
  id: CWE-595
CWE-596:
  name: 'DEPRECATED: Incorrect Semantic Object Comparison'
  description: This weakness has been deprecated. It was poorly described and difficult

  id: CWE-596
CWE-597:
  name: Use of Wrong Operator in String Comparison
  description: In Java, using == or != to compare two strings for equality actually
    compares two objects for equality rather than their string values for equality.
    Chances are good that the two references will never be equal. While this weakness
    often only affects program correctness, if the equality is used for a security
    decision, the unintended comparison result could be leveraged to affect program
    security.

CWE-600:
  name: 'Uncaught Exception in Servlet '
  description: When a Servlet throws an exception, the default error response the
    Servlet container sends back to the user typically includes debugging information.
    This information is of great value to an attacker. For example, a stack trace
    might show the attacker a malformed SQL query string, the type of database being
    used, and the version of the application container. This information enables the
    attacker to target known vulnerabilities in these components.

  name: Multiple Binds to the Same Port
  description: On most systems, a combination of setting the SO_REUSEADDR socket option,
    and a call to bind() allows any process to bind to a port to which a previous
    process has bound with INADDR_ANY. This allows a user to bind to the specific

  name: Double-Checked Locking
  description: Double-checked locking refers to the situation where a programmer checks
    to see if a resource has been initialized, grabs a lock, checks again to see if
    the resource has been initialized, and then performs the initialization if it
    has not occurred yet. This should not be done, as it is not guaranteed to work
    in all languages and on all architectures. In summary, other threads may not be
    operating inside the synchronous block and are not guaranteed to see the operations
    execute in the same order as they would appear inside the synchronous block.

  id: CWE-610
CWE-611:
  name: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
  description: XML documents optionally contain a Document Type Definition (DTD),
    which, among other features, enables the definition of XML entities. It is possible
    to define an entity by providing a substitution string in the form of a URI. The
    XML parser can access the contents of this URI and embed these contents back into
    the XML document for further processing. By submitting an XML file that defines
    an external entity with a file:// URI, an attacker can cause the processing application
    to read the contents of a local file. For example, a URI such as file:///c:/winnt/win.ini
    designates (in Windows) the file C:Winntwin.ini, or file:///etc/passwd designates
    the password file in Unix-based systems. Using URIs with other schemes such as
    http://, the attacker can force the application to make outgoing requests to servers
    that the attacker cannot reach directly, which can be used to bypass firewall
    restrictions or hide the source of attacks such as port scanning. Once the content
    of the URI is read, it is fed back into the application that is processing the
    XML. This application may echo back the data (e.g. in an error message), thereby
    exposing the file contents.
  id: CWE-611
CWE-612:
  name: Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information
  description: Web sites and other document repositories may apply an indexing routine
    against a group of private documents to facilitate search. If the index's results
    are available to parties who do not have access to the documents being indexed,
    then attackers could obtain portions of the documents by conducting targeted searches
    and reading the results. The risk is especially dangerous if search results include
    surrounding text that was not part of the search query. This issue can appear
    in search engines that are not configured (or implemented) to ignore critical
    files that should remain hidden; even without permissions to download these files
    directly, the remote user could read them.
  id: CWE-612

CWE-615:
  name: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code Comments
  description: An attacker who finds these comments can map the application's structure

    the site.
  id: CWE-615
CWE-616:
  name: Incomplete Identification of Uploaded File Variables (PHP)
  description: These global variables could be overwritten by POST requests, cookies,

    to read or process arbitrary files by providing values such as /etc/passwd.
  id: CWE-616
CWE-617:
  name: Reachable Assertion
  description: While assertion is good for catching logic errors and reducing the
    chances of reaching more serious vulnerability conditions, it can still lead to
    a denial of service. For example, if a server handles multiple simultaneous connections,
    and an assert() occurs in one single connection that causes all other connections
    to be dropped, this is a reachable assertion that leads to a denial of service.
  id: CWE-617
CWE-618:
  name: Exposed Unsafe ActiveX Method
  description: ActiveX controls can exercise far greater control over the operating
    system than typical Java or javascript. Exposed methods can be subject to various

CWE-621:
  name: Variable Extraction Error
  description: For example, in PHP, extraction can be used to provide functionality
    similar to register_globals, a dangerous functionality that is frequently disabled
    in production systems. Calling extract() or import_request_variables() without
    the proper arguments could allow arbitrary global variables to be overwritten,
    including superglobals. Similar functionality is possible in other interpreted
    languages, including custom languages.
  id: CWE-621
CWE-622:

  id: CWE-625
CWE-626:
  name: Null Byte Interaction Error (Poison Null Byte)
  description: A null byte (NUL character) can have different meanings across representations
    or languages. For example, it is a string terminator in standard C libraries,
    but Perl and PHP strings do not treat it as a terminator. When two representations
    are crossed - such as when Perl or PHP invokes underlying C functionality - this
    can produce an interaction error with unexpected results. Similar issues have
    been reported for ASP. Other interpreters written in C might also be affected.
    The poison null byte is frequently useful in path traversal attacks by terminating
    hard-coded extensions that are added to a filename. It can play a role in regular
    expression processing in PHP.

  name: Not Failing Securely ('Failing Open')
  description: By entering a less secure state, the product inherits the weaknesses
    associated with that state, making it easier to compromise. At the least, it causes
    administrators to have a false sense of security. This weakness typically occurs
    as a result of wanting to fail functional to minimize administration and support
    costs, instead of failing safe.
  id: CWE-636
CWE-637:
  name: Unnecessary Complexity in Protection Mechanism (Not Using 'Economy of Mechanism')
  description: Security mechanisms should be as simple as possible. Complex security
    mechanisms may engender partial implementations and compatibility problems, with
    resulting mismatches in assumptions and implemented security. A corollary of this
    principle is that data specifications should be as simple as possible, because
    complex data specifications result in complex validation code. Complex tasks and
    systems may also need to be guarded by complex security checks, so simple systems
    should be preferred.
  id: CWE-637
CWE-638:
  name: Not Using Complete Mediation
  description: The product does not perform access checks on a resource every time
    the resource is accessed by an entity, which can create resultant weaknesses if
    that entity's rights or privileges change over time.
  id: CWE-638
CWE-639:
  name: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
  description: Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value
    that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record
    stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation
    to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user
    in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the
    data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation
    has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing
    any other authorization checks present in the system. For example, attackers can
    look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and
    determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally.
    The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL
    parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it
    will be possible to tamper with the key value. One manifestation of this weakness
    is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that
    would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify
    their data.
  id: CWE-639
CWE-640:
  name: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password
  description: It is common for an application to have a mechanism that provides a
    means for a user to gain access to their account in the event they forget their
    password. Very often the password recovery mechanism is weak, which has the effect
    of making it more likely that it would be possible for a person other than the
    legitimate system user to gain access to that user's account. Weak password recovery
    schemes completely undermine a strong password authentication scheme. This weakness
    may be that the security question is too easy to guess or find an answer to (e.g.
    because the question is too common, or the answers can be found using social media).
    Or there might be an implementation weakness in the password recovery mechanism
    code that may for instance trick the system into e-mailing the new password to
    an e-mail account other than that of the user. There might be no throttling done
    on the rate of password resets so that a legitimate user can be denied service
    by an attacker if an attacker tries to recover their password in a rapid succession.
    The system may send the original password to the user rather than generating a
    new temporary password. In summary, password recovery functionality, if not carefully
    designed and implemented can often become the system's weakest link that can be
    misused in a way that would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the
    system.
  id: CWE-640
CWE-641:
  name: Improper Restriction of Names for Files and Other Resources
  description: This may produce resultant weaknesses. For instance, if the names of
    these resources contain scripting characters, it is possible that a script may
    get executed in the client's browser if the application ever displays the name
    of the resource on a dynamically generated web page. Alternately, if the resources
    are consumed by some application parser, a specially crafted name can exploit
    some vulnerability internal to the parser, potentially resulting in execution
    of arbitrary code on the server machine. The problems will vary based on the context
    of usage of such malformed resource names and whether vulnerabilities are present
    in or assumptions are made by the targeted technology that would make code execution
    possible.
  id: CWE-641
CWE-642:
  name: External Control of Critical State Data
  description: If an attacker can modify the state information without detection,
    then it could be used to perform unauthorized actions or access unexpected resources,
    since the application programmer does not expect that the state can be changed.
    State information can be stored in various locations such as a cookie, in a hidden
    web form field, input parameter or argument, an environment variable, a database
    record, within a settings file, etc. All of these locations have the potential
    to be modified by an attacker. When this state information is used to control
    security or determine resource usage, then it may create a vulnerability. For
    example, an application may perform authentication, then save the state in an
    authenticated=true cookie. An attacker may simply create this cookie in order
    to bypass the authentication.
  id: CWE-642
CWE-643:
  name: Improper Neutralization of Data within XPath Expressions ('XPath Injection')
  description: The net effect is that the attacker will have control over the information
    selected from the XML database and may use that ability to control application
    flow, modify logic, retrieve unauthorized data, or bypass important checks (e.g.
    authentication).
  id: CWE-643
CWE-644:
  name: Improper Neutralization of HTTP Headers for Scripting Syntax
  description: An attacker may be able to conduct cross-site scripting and other attacks
    against users who have these components enabled. If a product does not neutralize
    user controlled data being placed in the header of an HTTP response coming from
    the server, the header may contain a script that will get executed in the client's
    browser context, potentially resulting in a cross site scripting vulnerability
    or possibly an HTTP response splitting attack. It is important to carefully control
    data that is being placed both in HTTP response header and in the HTTP response
    body to ensure that no scripting syntax is present, taking various encodings into
    account.
  id: CWE-644
CWE-645:
  name: Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism
  description: Account lockout is a security feature often present in applications
    as a countermeasure to the brute force attack on the password based authentication
    mechanism of the system. After a certain number of failed login attempts, the
    users' account may be disabled for a certain period of time or until it is unlocked
    by an administrator. Other security events may also possibly trigger account lockout.
    However, an attacker may use this very security feature to deny service to legitimate
    system users. It is therefore important to ensure that the account lockout security
    mechanism is not overly restrictive.
  id: CWE-645
CWE-646:
  name: Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File
  description: An application might use the file name or extension of a user-supplied
    file to determine the proper course of action, such as selecting the correct process
    to which control should be passed, deciding what data should be made available,
    or what resources should be allocated. If the attacker can cause the code to misclassify
    the supplied file, then the wrong action could occur. For example, an attacker
    could supply a file that ends in a .php.gif extension that appears to be a GIF
    image, but would be processed as PHP code. In extreme cases, code execution is
    possible, but the attacker could also cause exhaustion of resources, denial of
    service, exposure of debug or system data (including application source code),
    or being bound to a particular server side process. This weakness may be due to
    a vulnerability in any of the technologies used by the web and application servers,
    due to misconfiguration, or resultant from another flaw in the application itself.
  id: CWE-646
CWE-647:
  name: Use of Non-Canonical URL Paths for Authorization Decisions
  description: 'If an application defines policy namespaces and makes authorization
    decisions based on the URL, but it does not require or convert to a canonical
    URL before making the authorization decision, then it opens the application to
    attack. For example, if the application only wants to allow access to http://www.example.com/mypage,
    then the attacker might be able to bypass this restriction using equivalent URLs
    such as: http://WWW.EXAMPLE.COM/mypage http://www.example.com/%6Dypage (alternate
    encoding) http://192.168.1.1/mypage (IP address) http://www.example.com/mypage/
    (trailing /) http://www.example.com:80/mypage Therefore it is important to specify
    access control policy that is based on the path information in some canonical
    form with all alternate encodings rejected (which can be accomplished by a default
    deny rule).'
  id: CWE-647
CWE-648:
  name: Incorrect Use of Privileged APIs
  description: 'When a product contains certain functions that perform operations
    requiring an elevated level of privilege, the caller of a privileged API must
    be careful to: ensure that assumptions made by the APIs are valid, such as validity
    of arguments account for known weaknesses in the design/implementation of the
    API call the API from a safe context If the caller of the API does not follow
    these requirements, then it may allow a malicious user or process to elevate their
    privilege, hijack the process, or steal sensitive data. For instance, it is important
    to know if privileged APIs do not shed their privileges before returning to the
    caller or if the privileged function might make certain assumptions about the
    data, context or state information passed to it by the caller. It is important
    to always know when and how privileged APIs can be called in order to ensure that
    their elevated level of privilege cannot be exploited.'
  id: CWE-648
CWE-649:
  name: Reliance on Obfuscation or Encryption of Security-Relevant Inputs without
    Integrity Checking
  description: When an application relies on obfuscation or incorrectly applied /
    weak encryption to protect client-controllable tokens or parameters, that may
    have an effect on the user state, system state, or some decision made on the server.
    Without protecting the tokens/parameters for integrity, the application is vulnerable
    to an attack where an adversary traverses the space of possible values of the
    said token/parameter in order to attempt to gain an advantage. The goal of the
    attacker is to find another admissible value that will somehow elevate their privileges
    in the system, disclose information or change the behavior of the system in some
    way beneficial to the attacker. If the application does not protect these critical
    tokens/parameters for integrity, it will not be able to determine that these values
    have been tampered with. Measures that are used to protect data for confidentiality
    should not be relied upon to provide the integrity service.
  id: CWE-649
CWE-650:
  name: Trusting HTTP Permission Methods on the Server Side
  description: The HTTP GET method and some other methods are designed to retrieve
    resources and not to alter the state of the application or resources on the server
    side. Furthermore, the HTTP specification requires that GET requests (and other
    requests) should not have side effects. Believing that it will be enough to prevent
    unintended resource alterations, an application may disallow the HTTP requests
    to perform DELETE, PUT and POST operations on the resource representation. However,
    there is nothing in the HTTP protocol itself that actually prevents the HTTP GET
    method from performing more than just query of the data. Developers can easily
    code programs that accept a HTTP GET request that do in fact create, update or
    delete data on the server. For instance, it is a common practice with REST based
    Web Services to have HTTP GET requests modifying resources on the server side.
    However, whenever that happens, the access control needs to be properly enforced
    in the application. No assumptions should be made that only HTTP DELETE, PUT,
    POST, and other methods have the power to alter the representation of the resource
    being accessed in the request.

CWE-651:
  name: Exposure of WSDL File Containing Sensitive Information
  description: 'An information exposure may occur if any of the following apply: The
    WSDL file is accessible to a wider audience than intended. The WSDL file contains
    information on the methods/services that should not be publicly accessible or
    information about deprecated methods. This problem is made more likely due to
    the WSDL often being automatically generated from the code. Information in the
    WSDL file helps guess names/locations of methods/resources that should not be
    publicly accessible.'

CWE-652:
  name: Improper Neutralization of Data within XQuery Expressions ('XQuery Injection')
  description: The net effect is that the attacker will have control over the information

CWE-654:
  name: Reliance on a Single Factor in a Security Decision
  description: A protection mechanism relies exclusively, or to a large extent, on
    the evaluation of a single condition or the integrity of a single object or entity
    in order to make a decision about granting access to restricted resources or functionality.
  id: CWE-654
CWE-655:
  name: Insufficient Psychological Acceptability
  description: The product has a protection mechanism that is too difficult or inconvenient
    to use, encouraging non-malicious users to disable or bypass the mechanism, whether
    by accident or on purpose.
  id: CWE-655
CWE-656:
  name: Reliance on Security Through Obscurity
  description: This reliance on security through obscurity can produce resultant weaknesses
    if an attacker is able to reverse engineer the inner workings of the mechanism.
    Note that obscurity can be one small part of defense in depth, since it can create
    more work for an attacker; however, it is a significant risk if used as the primary
    means of protection.
  id: CWE-656
CWE-657:
  name: Violation of Secure Design Principles
  description: This can introduce resultant weaknesses or make it easier for developers
    to introduce related weaknesses during implementation. Because code is centered
    around design, it can be resource-intensive to fix design problems.
  id: CWE-657
CWE-662:
  name: Improper Synchronization
  description: Synchronization refers to a variety of behaviors and mechanisms that
    allow two or more independently-operating processes or threads to ensure that
    they operate on shared resources in predictable ways that do not interfere with
    each other. Some shared resource operations cannot be executed atomically; that
    is, multiple steps must be guaranteed to execute sequentially, without any interference
    by other processes. Synchronization mechanisms vary widely, but they may include
    locking, mutexes, and semaphores. When a multi-step operation on a shared resource
    cannot be guaranteed to execute independent of interference, then the resulting
    behavior can be unpredictable. Improper synchronization could lead to data or
    memory corruption, denial of service, etc.
  id: CWE-662
CWE-663:
  name: Use of a Non-reentrant Function in a Concurrent Context
  description: The product calls a non-reentrant function in a concurrent context
    in which a competing code sequence (e.g. thread or signal handler) may have an
    opportunity to call the same function or otherwise influence its state.
  id: CWE-663
CWE-664:
  name: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
  description: Resources often have explicit instructions on how to be created, used
    and destroyed. When code does not follow these instructions, it can lead to unexpected
    behaviors and potentially exploitable states. Even without explicit instructions,
    various principles are expected to be adhered to, such as Do not use an object
    until after its creation is complete, or do not use an object after it has been
    slated for destruction.
  id: CWE-664
CWE-665:
  name: Improper Initialization
  description: This can have security implications when the associated resource is
    expected to have certain properties or values, such as a variable that determines
    whether a user has been authenticated or not.
  id: CWE-665
CWE-666:
  name: Operation on Resource in Wrong Phase of Lifetime
  description: 'A resource''s lifecycle includes several phases: initialization, use,
    and release. For each phase, it is important to follow the specifications outlined
    for how to operate on the resource and to ensure that the resource is in the expected
    phase. Otherwise, if a resource is in one phase but the operation is not valid
    for that phase (i.e., an incorrect phase of the resource''s lifetime), then this
    can produce resultant weaknesses. For example, using a resource before it has
    been fully initialized could cause corruption or incorrect data to be used.'
  id: CWE-666
CWE-667:
  name: Improper Locking
  description: Locking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple
    independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other
    when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow
    the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if
    no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared
    resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process.
    This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.
  id: CWE-667
CWE-668:
  name: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
  description: Resources such as files and directories may be inadvertently exposed
    through mechanisms such as insecure permissions, or when a program accidentally
    operates on the wrong object. For example, a program may intend that private files
    can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere
    that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the
    file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to
    access those files. A separate control sphere might effectively require that the
    user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system.
    If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files,
    then the user might be able to access other files on the system. In either case,
    the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.
  id: CWE-668
CWE-669:
  name: Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres
  description: The product does not properly transfer a resource/behavior to another
    sphere, or improperly imports a resource/behavior from another sphere, in a manner
    that provides unintended control over that resource.
  id: CWE-669
CWE-670:
  name: Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation
  description: This weakness captures cases in which a particular code segment is
    always incorrect with respect to the algorithm that it is implementing. For example,
    if a C programmer intends to include multiple statements in a single block but
    does not include the enclosing braces (CWE-483), then the logic is always incorrect.
    This issue is in contrast to most weaknesses in which the code usually behaves
    correctly, except when it is externally manipulated in malicious ways.
  id: CWE-670
CWE-671:
  name: Lack of Administrator Control over Security
  description: If the product's administrator does not have the ability to manage
    security-related decisions at all times, then protecting the product from outside
    threats - including the product's developer - can become impossible. For example,
    a hard-coded account name and password cannot be changed by the administrator,
    thus exposing that product to attacks that the administrator can not prevent.
  id: CWE-671
CWE-672:
  name: Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release
  description: The product uses, accesses, or otherwise operates on a resource after
    that resource has been expired, released, or revoked.
  id: CWE-672
CWE-673:
  name: External Influence of Sphere Definition
  description: Typically, a product defines its control sphere within the code itself,
    or through configuration by the product's administrator. In some cases, an external
    party can change the definition of the control sphere. This is typically a resultant
    weakness.
  id: CWE-673

    a vulnerability if it is used incorrectly, but the function can also be used safely.
  id: CWE-676
CWE-680:
  name: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow
  description: The product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to
    allocate, but an integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated
    than expected, leading to a buffer overflow.
  id: CWE-680
CWE-681:
  name: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
  description: When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer,
    data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If
    the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors
    may occur.
  id: CWE-681
CWE-682:
  name: Incorrect Calculation
  description: When product performs a security-critical calculation incorrectly,
    it might lead to incorrect resource allocations, incorrect privilege assignments,
    or failed comparisons among other things. Many of the direct results of an incorrect
    calculation can lead to even larger problems such as failed protection mechanisms
    or even arbitrary code execution.
  id: CWE-682
CWE-683:
  name: Function Call With Incorrect Order of Arguments
  description: While this weakness might be caught by the compiler in some languages,
    it can occur more frequently in cases in which the called function accepts variable
    numbers or types of arguments, such as format strings in C. It also can occur
    in languages or environments that do not enforce strong typing.
  id: CWE-683
CWE-684:
  name: Incorrect Provision of Specified Functionality
  description: When providing functionality to an external party, it is important
    that the product behaves in accordance with the details specified. When requirements
    of nuances are not documented, the functionality may produce unintended behaviors
    for the caller, possibly leading to an exploitable state.
  id: CWE-684
CWE-685:
  name: Function Call With Incorrect Number of Arguments
  description: The product calls a function, procedure, or routine, but the caller
    specifies too many arguments, or too few arguments, which may lead to undefined
    behavior and resultant weaknesses.
  id: CWE-685
CWE-686:
  name: Function Call With Incorrect Argument Type
  description: This weakness is most likely to occur in loosely typed languages, or
    in strongly typed languages in which the types of variable arguments cannot be
    enforced at compilation time, or where there is implicit casting.
  id: CWE-686
CWE-687:

CWE-689:
  name: Permission Race Condition During Resource Copy
  description: The product, while copying or cloning a resource, does not set the
    resource's permissions or access control until the copy is complete, leaving the
    resource exposed to other spheres while the copy is taking place.
  id: CWE-689
CWE-690:
  name: Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference
  description: While unchecked return value weaknesses are not limited to returns
    of NULL pointers (see the examples in CWE-252), functions often return NULL to
    indicate an error status. When this error condition is not checked, a NULL pointer
    dereference can occur.
  id: CWE-690

CWE-692:
  name: Incomplete Denylist to Cross-Site Scripting
  description: While XSS might seem simple to prevent, web browsers vary so widely
    in how they parse web pages, that a denylist cannot keep track of all the variations.
    The XSS Cheat Sheet [REF-714] contains a large number of attacks that are intended
    to bypass incomplete denylists.
  id: CWE-692
CWE-693:
  name: Protection Mechanism Failure
  description: This weakness covers three distinct situations. A missing protection
    mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a
    certain class of attack. An insufficient protection mechanism might provide some
    defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect
    against everything that is intended. Finally, an ignored mechanism occurs when
    a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer
    has not applied it in some code path.
  id: CWE-693
CWE-694:
  name: Use of Multiple Resources with Duplicate Identifier
  description: If the product assumes that each resource has a unique identifier,
    the product could operate on the wrong resource if attackers can cause multiple
    resources to be associated with the same identifier.
  id: CWE-694
CWE-695:
  name: Use of Low-Level Functionality
  description: The use of low-level functionality can violate the specification in
    unexpected ways that effectively disable built-in protection mechanisms, introduce
    exploitable inconsistencies, or otherwise expose the functionality to attack.

CWE-707:
  name: Improper Neutralization
  description: 'If a message is malformed, it may cause the message to be incorrectly
    interpreted. Neutralization is an abstract term for any technique that ensures
    that input (and output) conforms with expectations and is safe. This can be done
    by: checking that the input/output is already safe (e.g. validation) transformation
    of the input/output to be safe using techniques such as filtering, encoding/decoding,
    escaping/unescaping, quoting/unquoting, or canonicalization preventing the input/output
    from being directly provided by an attacker (e.g. indirect selection that maps
    externally-provided values to internally-controlled values) preventing the input/output
    from being processed at all This weakness typically applies in cases where the
    product prepares a control message that another process must act on, such as a
    command or query, and malicious input that was intended as data, can enter the
    control plane instead. However, this weakness also applies to more general cases
    where there are not always control implications.'

    can lead to resultant weaknesses or increase the severity of the associated vulnerabilities.
  id: CWE-710
CWE-732:
  name: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
  description: When a resource is given a permission setting that provides access
    to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive
    information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This
    is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration,
    execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage
    account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.

CWE-749:
  name: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
  description: 'This weakness can lead to a wide variety of resultant weaknesses,
    depending on the behavior of the exposed method. It can apply to any number of
    technologies and approaches, such as ActiveX controls, Java functions, IOCTLs,
    and so on. The exposure can occur in a few different ways: The function/method
    was never intended to be exposed to outside actors. The function/method was only
    intended to be accessible to a limited set of actors, such as Internet-based access
    from a single web site.'

CWE-754:
  name: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
  description: The programmer may assume that certain events or conditions will never
    occur or do not need to be worried about, such as low memory conditions, lack
    of access to resources due to restrictive permissions, or misbehaving clients
    or components. However, attackers may intentionally trigger these unusual conditions,
    thus violating the programmer's assumptions, possibly introducing instability,
    incorrect behavior, or a vulnerability. Note that this entry is not exclusively
    about the use of exceptions and exception handling, which are mechanisms for both
    checking and handling unusual or unexpected conditions.

    exposing sensitive information.
  id: CWE-756
CWE-757:
  name: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')
  description: When a security mechanism can be forced to downgrade to use a less
    secure algorithm, this can make it easier for attackers to compromise the product
    by exploiting weaker algorithm. The victim might not be aware that the less secure
    algorithm is being used. For example, if an attacker can force a communications
    channel to use cleartext instead of strongly-encrypted data, then the attacker
    could read the channel by sniffing, instead of going through extra effort of trying
    to decrypt the data using brute force techniques.
  id: CWE-757
CWE-758:
  name: Reliance on Undefined, Unspecified, or Implementation-Defined Behavior

CWE-759:
  name: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt
  description: This makes it easier for attackers to pre-compute the hash value using
    dictionary attack techniques such as rainbow tables. It should be noted that,
    despite common perceptions, the use of a good salt with a hash does not sufficiently
    increase the effort for an attacker who is targeting an individual password, or
    who has a large amount of computing resources available, such as with cloud-based
    services or specialized, inexpensive hardware. Offline password cracking can still
    be effective if the hash function is not expensive to compute; many cryptographic
    functions are designed to be efficient and can be vulnerable to attacks using
    massive computing resources, even if the hash is cryptographically strong. The
    use of a salt only slightly increases the computing requirements for an attacker
    compared to other strategies such as adaptive hash functions. See CWE-916 for
    more details.

  description: This can cause the product to crash, or in some cases, modify critical
    program variables or execute code. This weakness often occurs when the memory
    is allocated explicitly on the heap with one of the malloc() family functions
    and free() is called, but pointer arithmetic has caused the pointer to be in the
    interior or end of the buffer.
  id: CWE-761
CWE-762:
  name: Mismatched Memory Management Routines
  description: 'This weakness can be generally described as mismatching memory management
    routines, such as: The memory was allocated on the stack (automatically), but
    it was deallocated using the memory management routine free() (CWE-590), which
    is intended for explicitly allocated heap memory. The memory was allocated explicitly
    using one set of memory management functions, and deallocated using a different
    set. For example, memory might be allocated with malloc() in C++ instead of the
    new operator, and then deallocated with the delete operator. When the memory management
    functions are mismatched, the consequences may be as severe as code execution,
    memory corruption, or program crash. Consequences and ease of exploit will vary
    depending on the implementation of the routines and the object being managed.'
  id: CWE-762
CWE-763:
  name: Release of Invalid Pointer or Reference
  description: 'This weakness can take several forms, such as: The memory was allocated,
    explicitly or implicitly, via one memory management method and deallocated using
    a different, non-compatible function (CWE-762). The function calls or memory management
    routines chosen are appropriate, however they are used incorrectly, such as in
    CWE-761.'
  id: CWE-763
CWE-764:
  name: Multiple Locks of a Critical Resource
  description: When a product is operating in a concurrent environment and repeatedly
    locks a critical resource, the consequences will vary based on the type of lock,
    the lock's implementation, and the resource being protected. In some situations
    such as with semaphores, the resources are pooled and extra locking calls will
    reduce the size of the total available pool, possibly leading to degraded performance
    or a denial of service. If this can be triggered by an attacker, it will be similar
    to an unrestricted lock (CWE-412). In the context of a binary lock, it is likely
    that any duplicate locking attempts will never succeed since the lock is already
    held and progress may not be possible.
  id: CWE-764
CWE-765:
  name: Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource
  description: When the product is operating in a concurrent environment and repeatedly
    unlocks a critical resource, the consequences will vary based on the type of lock,
    the lock's implementation, and the resource being protected. In some situations
    such as with semaphores, the resources are pooled and extra calls to unlock will
    increase the count for the number of available resources, likely resulting in
    a crash or unpredictable behavior when the system nears capacity.
  id: CWE-765
CWE-766:
  name: Critical Data Element Declared Public
  description: This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly
    affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or
    fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.
  id: CWE-766
CWE-767:
  name: Access to Critical Private Variable via Public Method
  description: If an attacker modifies the variable to contain unexpected values,
    this could violate assumptions from other parts of the code. Additionally, if
    an attacker can read the private variable, it may expose sensitive information
    or make it easier to launch further attacks.
  id: CWE-767
CWE-768:
  name: Incorrect Short Circuit Evaluation
  description: Usage of short circuit evaluation, though well-defined in the C standard,
    may alter control flow in a way that introduces logic errors that are difficult
    to detect, possibly causing errors later during the product's execution. If an
    attacker can discover such an inconsistency, it may be exploitable to gain arbitrary
    control over a system. If the first condition of an or statement is assumed to
    be true under normal circumstances, or if the first condition of an and statement
    is assumed to be false, then any subsequent conditional may contain its own logic
    errors that are not detected during code review or testing. Finally, the usage
    of short circuit evaluation may decrease the maintainability of the code.

    All content has been transferred to CWE-774.
  id: CWE-769
CWE-770:
  name: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
  description: Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers
    must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too
    easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms,
    it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many
    requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many
    resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent
    the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.
  id: CWE-770
CWE-771:
  name: Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource
  description: This does not necessarily apply in languages or frameworks that automatically
    perform garbage collection, since the removal of all references may act as a signal
    that the resource is ready to be reclaimed.
  id: CWE-771
CWE-772:
  name: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime
  description: When a resource is not released after use, it can allow attackers to
    cause a denial of service by causing the allocation of resources without triggering
    their release. Frequently-affected resources include memory, CPU, disk space,
    power or battery, etc.
  id: CWE-772
CWE-773:
  name: Missing Reference to Active File Descriptor or Handle
  description: This can cause the product to consume all available file descriptors

CWE-774:
  name: Allocation of File Descriptors or Handles Without Limits or Throttling
  description: This can cause the product to consume all available file descriptors
    or handles, which can prevent other processes from performing critical file processing
    operations.
  id: CWE-774
CWE-775:
  name: Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime
  description: When a file descriptor or handle is not released after use (typically
    by explicitly closing it), attackers can cause a denial of service by consuming
    all available file descriptors/handles, or otherwise preventing other system processes
    from obtaining their own file descriptors/handles.
  id: CWE-775
CWE-776:
  name: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')
  description: If the DTD contains a large number of nested or recursive entities,
    this can lead to explosive growth of data when parsed, causing a denial of service.
  id: CWE-776
CWE-777:
  name: Regular Expression without Anchors
  description: When performing tasks such as validating against a set of allowed inputs
    (allowlist), data is examined and possibly modified to ensure that it is well-formed
    and adheres to a list of safe values. If the regular expression is not anchored,
    malicious or malformed data may be included before or after any string matching
    the regular expression. The type of malicious data that is allowed will depend
    on the context of the application and which anchors are omitted from the regular
    expression.
  id: CWE-777
CWE-778:
  name: Insufficient Logging
  description: When security-critical events are not logged properly, such as a failed
    login attempt, this can make malicious behavior more difficult to detect and may
    hinder forensic analysis after an attack succeeds. As organizations adopt cloud
    storage resources, these technologies often require configuration changes to enable
    detailed logging information, since detailed logging can incur additional costs.
    This could lead to telemetry gaps in critical audit logs. For example, in Azure,
    the default value for logging is disabled.
  id: CWE-778
CWE-779:
  name: Logging of Excessive Data
  description: While logging is a good practice in general, and very high levels of
    logging are appropriate for debugging stages of development, too much logging
    in a production environment might hinder a system administrator's ability to detect
    anomalous conditions. This can provide cover for an attacker while attempting
    to penetrate a system, clutter the audit trail for forensic analysis, or make
    it more difficult to debug problems in a production environment.
  id: CWE-779
CWE-780:
  name: Use of RSA Algorithm without OAEP
  description: Padding schemes are often used with cryptographic algorithms to make
    the plaintext less predictable and complicate attack efforts. The OAEP scheme
    is often used with RSA to nullify the impact of predictable common text.
  id: CWE-780
CWE-781:
  name: Improper Address Validation in IOCTL with METHOD_NEITHER I/O Control Code
  description: When an IOCTL uses the METHOD_NEITHER option for I/O control, it is
    the responsibility of the IOCTL to validate the addresses that have been supplied
    to it. If validation is missing or incorrect, attackers can supply arbitrary memory
    addresses, leading to code execution or a denial of service.
  id: CWE-781
CWE-782:
  name: Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control
  description: When an IOCTL contains privileged functionality and is exposed unnecessarily,
    attackers may be able to access this functionality by invoking the IOCTL. Even
    if the functionality is benign, if the programmer has assumed that the IOCTL would
    only be accessed by a trusted process, there may be little or no validation of
    the incoming data, exposing weaknesses that would never be reachable if the attacker
    cannot call the IOCTL directly. The implementations of IOCTLs will differ between
    operating system types and versions, so the methods of attack and prevention may
    vary widely.
  id: CWE-782
CWE-783:
  name: Operator Precedence Logic Error
  description: While often just a bug, operator precedence logic errors can have serious
    consequences if they are used in security-critical code, such as making an authentication
    decision.
  id: CWE-783
CWE-784:
  name: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security
    Decision
  description: Attackers can easily modify cookies, within the browser or by implementing
    the client-side code outside of the browser. Attackers can bypass protection mechanisms
    such as authorization and authentication by modifying the cookie to contain an
    expected value.
  id: CWE-784
CWE-785:

CWE-798:
  name: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
  description: 'There are two main variations: Inbound: the product contains an authentication
    mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials.
    In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password
    is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded
    password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot
    be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the
    program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator
    to detect. Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and
    it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant
    applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end
    service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer
    may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.'

CWE-799:
  name: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
  description: This can allow the actor to perform actions more frequently than expected.
    The actor could be a human or an automated process such as a virus or bot. This
    could be used to cause a denial of service, compromise program logic (such as
    limiting humans to a single vote), or other consequences. For example, an authentication
    routine might not limit the number of times an attacker can guess a password.
    Or, a web site might conduct a poll but only expect humans to vote a maximum of
    once a day.

  name: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
  description: Developers may assume that inputs such as cookies, environment variables,
    and hidden form fields cannot be modified. However, an attacker could change these
    inputs using customized clients or other attacks. This change might not be detected.
    When security decisions such as authentication and authorization are made based
    on the values of these inputs, attackers can bypass the security of the software.
    Without sufficient encryption, integrity checking, or other mechanism, any input
    that originates from an outsider cannot be trusted.
  id: CWE-807
CWE-820:
  name: Missing Synchronization
  description: If access to a shared resource is not synchronized, then the resource
    may not be in a state that is expected by the product. This might lead to unexpected
    or insecure behaviors, especially if an attacker can influence the shared resource.
  id: CWE-820
CWE-821:
  name: Incorrect Synchronization
  description: If access to a shared resource is not correctly synchronized, then
    the resource may not be in a state that is expected by the product. This might
    lead to unexpected or insecure behaviors, especially if an attacker can influence
    the shared resource.
  id: CWE-821
CWE-822:
  name: Untrusted Pointer Dereference
  description: 'An attacker can supply a pointer for memory locations that the product
    is not expecting. If the pointer is dereferenced for a write operation, the attack
    might allow modification of critical state variables, cause a crash, or execute
    code. If the dereferencing operation is for a read, then the attack might allow
    reading of sensitive data, cause a crash, or set a variable to an unexpected value
    (since the value will be read from an unexpected memory location). There are several
    variants of this weakness, including but not necessarily limited to: The untrusted
    value is directly invoked as a function call. In OS kernels or drivers where there
    is a boundary between userland and privileged memory spaces, an untrusted pointer
    might enter through an API or system call (see CWE-781 for one such example).
    Inadvertently accepting the value from an untrusted control sphere when it did
    not have to be accepted as input at all. This might occur when the code was originally
    developed to be run by a single user in a non-networked environment, and the code
    is then ported to or otherwise exposed to a networked environment.'
  id: CWE-822
CWE-823:
  name: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset
  description: While a pointer can contain a reference to any arbitrary memory location,
    a program typically only intends to use the pointer to access limited portions
    of memory, such as contiguous memory used to access an individual array. Programs
    may use offsets in order to access fields or sub-elements stored within structured
    data. The offset might be out-of-range if it comes from an untrusted source, is
    the result of an incorrect calculation, or occurs because of another error. If
    an attacker can control or influence the offset so that it points outside of the
    intended boundaries of the structure, then the attacker may be able to read or
    write to memory locations that are used elsewhere in the product. As a result,
    the attack might change the state of the product as accessed through program variables,
    cause a crash or instable behavior, and possibly lead to code execution.
  id: CWE-823
CWE-824:
  name: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
  description: If the pointer contains an uninitialized value, then the value might
    not point to a valid memory location. This could cause the product to read from
    or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the
    uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could
    be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that
    is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code
    or perform other attacks. Depending on memory layout, associated memory management
    behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the
    contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control
    of the memory location to be accessed.
  id: CWE-824
CWE-825:
  name: Expired Pointer Dereference
  description: When a product releases memory, but it maintains a pointer to that
    memory, then the memory might be re-allocated at a later time. If the original
    pointer is accessed to read or write data, then this could cause the product to
    read or modify data that is in use by a different function or process. Depending
    on how the newly-allocated memory is used, this could lead to a denial of service,
    information exposure, or code execution.
  id: CWE-825
CWE-826:
  name: Premature Release of Resource During Expected Lifetime
  description: This weakness focuses on errors in which the product should not release
    a resource, but performs the release anyway. This is different than a weakness
    in which the product releases a resource at the appropriate time, but it maintains
    a reference to the resource, which it later accesses. For this weakness, the resource
    should still be valid upon the subsequent access. When a product releases a resource
    that is still being used, it is possible that operations will still be taken on
    this resource, which may have been repurposed in the meantime, leading to issues
    similar to CWE-825. Consequences may include denial of service, information exposure,
    or code execution.
  id: CWE-826
CWE-827:
  name: Improper Control of Document Type Definition
  description: As DTDs are processed, they might try to read or include files on the
    machine performing the parsing. If an attacker is able to control the DTD, then
    the attacker might be able to specify sensitive resources or requests or provide
    malicious content. For example, the SOAP specification prohibits SOAP messages
    from containing DTDs.
  id: CWE-827
CWE-828:
  name: Signal Handler with Functionality that is not Asynchronous-Safe
  description: 'This can lead to an unexpected system state with a variety of potential
    consequences depending on context, including denial of service and code execution.
    Signal handlers are typically intended to interrupt normal functionality of a
    program, or even other signals, in order to notify the process of an event. When
    a signal handler uses global or static variables, or invokes functions that ultimately
    depend on such state or its associated metadata, then it could corrupt system
    state that is being used by normal functionality. This could subject the program
    to race conditions or other weaknesses that allow an attacker to cause the program
    state to be corrupted. While denial of service is frequently the consequence,
    in some cases this weakness could be leveraged for code execution. There are several
    different scenarios that introduce this issue: Invocation of non-reentrant functions
    from within the handler. One example is malloc(), which modifies internal global
    variables as it manages memory. Very few functions are actually reentrant. Code
    sequences (not necessarily function calls) contain non-atomic use of global variables,
    or associated metadata or structures, that can be accessed by other functionality
    of the program, including other signal handlers. Frequently, the same function
    is registered to handle multiple signals. The signal handler function is intended
    to run at most one time, but instead it can be invoked multiple times. This could
    happen by repeated delivery of the same signal, or by delivery of different signals
    that have the same handler function (CWE-831). Note that in some environments
    or contexts, it might be possible for the signal handler to be interrupted itself.
    If both a signal handler and the normal behavior of the product have to operate
    on the same set of state variables, and a signal is received in the middle of
    the normal execution''s modifications of those variables, the variables may be
    in an incorrect or corrupt state during signal handler execution, and possibly
    still incorrect or corrupt upon return.'
  id: CWE-828
CWE-829:
  name: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere
  description: When including third-party functionality, such as a web widget, library,
    or other source of functionality, the product must effectively trust that functionality.
    Without sufficient protection mechanisms, the functionality could be malicious
    in nature (either by coming from an untrusted source, being spoofed, or being
    modified in transit from a trusted source). The functionality might also contain
    its own weaknesses, or grant access to additional functionality and state information
    that should be kept private to the base system, such as system state information,
    sensitive application data, or the DOM of a web application. This might lead to
    many different consequences depending on the included functionality, but some
    examples include injection of malware, information exposure by granting excessive
    privileges or permissions to the untrusted functionality, DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities,
    stealing user's cookies, or open redirect to malware (CWE-601).
  id: CWE-829
CWE-830:
  name: Inclusion of Web Functionality from an Untrusted Source
  description: Including third party functionality in a web-based environment is risky,
    especially if the source of the functionality is untrusted. Even if the third
    party is a trusted source, the product may still be exposed to attacks and malicious
    behavior if that trusted source is compromised, or if the code is modified in
    transmission from the third party to the product. This weakness is common in mashup
    development on the web, which may include source functionality from other domains.
    For example, Javascript-based web widgets may be inserted by using '<SCRIPT SRC=http://other.domain.here>'
    tags, which causes the code to run in the domain of the product, not the remote
    site from which the widget was loaded. As a result, the included code has access
    to the local DOM, including cookies and other data that the developer might not
    want the remote site to be able to access. Such dependencies may be desirable,
    or even required, but sometimes programmers are not aware that a dependency exists.
  id: CWE-830
CWE-831:
  name: Signal Handler Function Associated with Multiple Signals
  description: While sometimes intentional and safe, when the same function is used
    to handle multiple signals, a race condition could occur if the function uses
    any state outside of its local declaration, such as global variables or non-reentrant
    functions, or has any side effects. An attacker could send one signal that invokes
    the handler function; in many OSes, this will typically prevent the same signal
    from invoking the handler again, at least until the handler function has completed
    execution. However, the attacker could then send a different signal that is associated
    with the same handler function. This could interrupt the original handler function
    while it is still executing. If there is shared state, then the state could be
    corrupted. This can lead to a variety of potential consequences depending on context,
    including denial of service and code execution. Another rarely-explored possibility
    arises when the signal handler is only designed to be executed once (if at all).
    By sending multiple signals, an attacker could invoke the function more than once.
    This may generate extra, unintended side effects. A race condition might not even
    be necessary; the attacker could send one signal, wait until it is handled, then
    send the other signal.

CWE-832:
  name: Unlock of a Resource that is not Locked

  name: Excessive Iteration
  description: If the iteration can be influenced by an attacker, this weakness could
    allow attackers to consume excessive resources such as CPU or memory. In many
    cases, a loop does not need to be infinite in order to cause enough resource consumption
    to adversely affect the product or its host system; it depends on the amount of
    resources consumed per iteration.

  name: Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication
  description: Some authentication mechanisms rely on the client to generate the hash
    for a password, possibly to reduce load on the server or avoid sending the password
    across the network. However, when the client is used to generate the hash, an
    attacker can bypass the authentication by obtaining a copy of the hash, e.g. by
    using SQL injection to compromise a database of authentication credentials, or
    by exploiting an information exposure. The attacker could then use a modified
    client to replay the stolen hash without having knowledge of the original password.
    As a result, the server-side comparison against a client-side hash does not provide
    any more security than the use of passwords without hashing.

CWE-837:
  name: Improper Enforcement of a Single, Unique Action
  description: In various applications, a user is only expected to perform a certain
    action once, such as voting, requesting a refund, or making a purchase. When this
    restriction is not enforced, sometimes this can have security implications. For
    example, in a voting application, an attacker could attempt to stuff the ballot
    box by voting multiple times. If these votes are counted separately, then the
    attacker could directly affect who wins the vote. This could have significant
    business impact depending on the purpose of the product.
  id: CWE-837
CWE-838:
  name: Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context
  description: This weakness can cause the downstream component to use a decoding
    method that produces different data than what the product intended to send. When
    the wrong encoding is used - even if closely related - the downstream component
    could decode the data incorrectly. This can have security consequences when the
    provided boundaries between control and data are inadvertently broken, because
    the resulting data could introduce control characters or special elements that
    were not sent by the product. The resulting data could then be used to bypass
    protection mechanisms such as input validation, and enable injection attacks.
    While using output encoding is essential for ensuring that communications between
    components are accurate, the use of the wrong encoding - even if closely related
    - could cause the downstream component to misinterpret the output. For example,
    HTML entity encoding is used for elements in the HTML body of a web page. However,
    a programmer might use entity encoding when generating output for that is used
    within an attribute of an HTML tag, which could contain functional Javascript
    that is not affected by the HTML encoding. While web applications have received
    the most attention for this problem, this weakness could potentially apply to
    any type of product that uses a communications stream that could support multiple
    encodings.
  id: CWE-838
CWE-839:
  name: Numeric Range Comparison Without Minimum Check
  description: Some products use signed integers or floats even when their values
    are only expected to be positive or 0. An input validation check might assume
    that the value is positive, and only check for the maximum value. If the value
    is negative, but the code assumes that the value is positive, this can produce
    an error. The error may have security consequences if the negative value is used
    for memory allocation, array access, buffer access, etc. Ultimately, the error
    could lead to a buffer overflow or other type of memory corruption. The use of
    a negative number in a positive-only context could have security implications
    for other types of resources. For example, a shopping cart might check that the
    user is not requesting more than 10 items, but a request for -3 items could cause
    the application to calculate a negative price and credit the attacker's account.
  id: CWE-839
CWE-841:
  name: Improper Enforcement of Behavioral Workflow
  description: 'By performing actions in an unexpected order, or by omitting steps,
    an attacker could manipulate the business logic of the product or cause it to
    enter an invalid state. In some cases, this can also expose resultant weaknesses.
    For example, a file-sharing protocol might require that an actor perform separate
    steps to provide a username, then a password, before being able to transfer files.
    If the file-sharing server accepts a password command followed by a transfer command,
    without any username being provided, the product might still perform the transfer.
    Note that this is different than CWE-696, which focuses on when the product performs
    actions in the wrong sequence; this entry is closely related, but it is focused
    on ensuring that the actor performs actions in the correct sequence. Workflow-related
    behaviors include: Steps are performed in the expected order. Required steps are
    not omitted. Steps are not interrupted. Steps are performed in a timely fashion.'

  name: Placement of User into Incorrect Group
  description: If the incorrect group has more access or privileges than the intended

    resources or perform unexpected actions. The access-control system might not be
    able to detect malicious usage of this group membership.
  id: CWE-842
CWE-843:
  name: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')
  description: When the product accesses the resource using an incompatible type,
    this could trigger logical errors because the resource does not have expected
    properties. In languages without memory safety, such as C and C++, type confusion
    can lead to out-of-bounds memory access. While this weakness is frequently associated
    with unions when parsing data with many different embedded object types in C,
    it can be present in any application that can interpret the same variable or memory
    location in multiple ways. This weakness is not unique to C and C++. For example,
    errors in PHP applications can be triggered by providing array parameters when
    scalars are expected, or vice versa. Languages such as Perl, which perform automatic
    conversion of a variable of one type when it is accessed as if it were another
    type, can also contain these issues.

  name: Use of Uninitialized Resource
  description: When a resource has not been properly initialized, the product may

    the product.
  id: CWE-908
CWE-909:
  name: Missing Initialization of Resource
  description: Many resources require initialization before they can be properly used.
    If a resource is not initialized, it could contain unpredictable or expired data,

    implications when the resource is expected to have certain properties or values.

  name: Use of Expired File Descriptor
  description: After a file descriptor for a particular file or device has been released,
    it can be reused. The code might not write to the original file, since the reused
    file descriptor might reference a different file or device.
  id: CWE-910
CWE-911:
  name: Improper Update of Reference Count
  description: Reference counts can be used when tracking how many objects contain
    a reference to a particular resource, such as in memory management or garbage
    collection. When the reference count reaches zero, the resource can be de-allocated
    or reused because there are no more objects that use it. If the reference count
    accidentally reaches zero, then the resource might be released too soon, even
    though it is still in use. If all objects no longer use the resource, but the
    reference count is not zero, then the resource might not ever be released.
  id: CWE-911
CWE-912:
  name: Hidden Functionality
  description: Hidden functionality can take many forms, such as intentionally malicious
    code, Easter Eggs that contain extraneous functionality such as games, developer-friendly
    shortcuts that reduce maintenance or support costs such as hard-coded accounts,
    etc. From a security perspective, even when the functionality is not intentionally
    malicious or damaging, it can increase the product's attack surface and expose
    additional weaknesses beyond what is already exposed by the intended functionality.
    Even if it is not easily accessible, the hidden functionality could be useful
    for attacks that modify the control flow of the application.
  id: CWE-912
CWE-913:
  name: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources
  description: Many languages offer powerful features that allow the programmer to
    dynamically create or modify existing code, or resources used by code such as
    variables and objects. While these features can offer significant flexibility
    and reduce development time, they can be extremely dangerous if attackers can
    directly influence these code resources in unexpected ways.
  id: CWE-913
CWE-914:
  name: Improper Control of Dynamically-Identified Variables
  description: Many languages offer powerful features that allow the programmer to
    access arbitrary variables that are specified by an input string. While these
    features can offer significant flexibility and reduce development time, they can
    be extremely dangerous if attackers can modify unintended variables that have
    security implications.
  id: CWE-914
CWE-915:
  name: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes
  description: If the object contains attributes that were only intended for internal
    use, then their unexpected modification could lead to a vulnerability. This weakness
    is sometimes known by the language-specific mechanisms that make it possible,
    such as mass assignment, autobinding, or object injection.
  id: CWE-915
CWE-916:
  name: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
  description: 'Many password storage mechanisms compute a hash and store the hash,
    instead of storing the original password in plaintext. In this design, authentication
    involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it
    to the stored hash. Many hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with
    minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem
    for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker''s workload for brute-force
    password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method
    (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can
    store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by
    computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can
    compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible
    passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing
    (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario,
    an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker. There are several properties of
    a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel
    attack: The amount of CPU time required to compute the hash (stretching) The amount
    of memory required to compute the hash (memory-hard operations) Including a random
    value, along with the password, as input to the hash computation (salting) Given
    a hash, there is no known way of determining an input (e.g., a password) that
    produces this hash value, other than by guessing possible inputs (one-way hashing)
    Relative to the number of all possible hashes that can be generated by the scheme,
    there is a low likelihood of producing the same hash for multiple different inputs
    (collision resistance) Note that the security requirements for the product may
    vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes
    might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security
    for the environment. Conversely, a solution might be very strong in preserving
    one property, which still being very weak for an attack against another property,
    or it might not be able to significantly reduce the efficiency of a massively-parallel
    attack.'

CWE-917:
  name: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language
    Statement ('Expression Language Injection')
  description: Frameworks such as Java Server Page (JSP) allow a developer to insert
    executable expressions within otherwise-static content. When the developer is
    not aware of the executable nature of these expressions and/or does not disable
    them, then if an attacker can inject expressions, this could lead to code execution
    or other unexpected behaviors.

CWE-920:
  name: Improper Restriction of Power Consumption
  description: 'In environments such as embedded or mobile devices, power can be a
    limited resource such as a battery, which cannot be automatically replenished
    by the product itself, and the device might not always be directly attached to
    a reliable power source. If the product uses too much power too quickly, then
    this could cause the device (and subsequently, the product) to stop functioning
    until power is restored, or increase the financial burden on the device owner
    because of increased power costs. Normal operation of an application will consume
    power. However, in some cases, an attacker could cause the application to consume
    more power than intended, using components such as: Display CPU Disk I/O GPS Sound
    Microphone USB interface'
  id: CWE-920
CWE-921:
  name: Storage of Sensitive Data in a Mechanism without Access Control
  description: While many modern file systems or devices utilize some form of access
    control in order to restrict access to data, not all storage mechanisms have this
    capability. For example, memory cards, floppy disks, CDs, and USB devices are
    typically made accessible to any user within the system. This can become a problem
    when sensitive data is stored in these mechanisms in a multi-user environment,
    because anybody on the system can read or write this data. On Android devices,
    external storage is typically globally readable and writable by other applications
    on the device. External storage may also be easily accessible through the mobile
    device's USB connection or physically accessible through the device's memory card
    port.
  id: CWE-921
CWE-922:
  name: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information

  name: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
  description: Attackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different

    While this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients
    and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this
    weakness.

CWE-925:
  name: Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver
  description: Certain types of Intents, identified by action string, can only be
    broadcast by the operating system itself, not by third-party applications. However,
    when an application registers to receive these implicit system intents, it is
    also registered to receive any explicit intents. While a malicious application
    cannot send an implicit system intent, it can send an explicit intent to the target
    application, which may assume that any received intent is a valid implicit system
    intent and not an explicit intent from another application. This may lead to unintended
    behavior.
  id: CWE-925
CWE-926:
  name: Improper Export of Android Application Components
  description: 'The attacks and consequences of improperly exporting a component may
    depend on the exported component: If access to an exported Activity is not restricted,
    any application will be able to launch the activity. This may allow a malicious
    application to gain access to sensitive information, modify the internal state
    of the application, or trick a user into interacting with the victim application
    while believing they are still interacting with the malicious application. If
    access to an exported Service is not restricted, any application may start and
    bind to the Service. Depending on the exposed functionality, this may allow a
    malicious application to perform unauthorized actions, gain access to sensitive
    information, or corrupt the internal state of the application. If access to a
    Content Provider is not restricted to only the expected applications, then malicious
    applications might be able to access the sensitive data. Note that in Android
    before 4.2, the Content Provider is automatically exported unless it has been
    explicitly declared as NOT exported.'
  id: CWE-926
CWE-927:
  name: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication
  description: Since an implicit intent does not specify a particular application
    to receive the data, any application can process the intent by using an Intent
    Filter for that intent. This can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive
    data. There are two variations on the standard broadcast intent, ordered and sticky.
    Ordered broadcast intents are delivered to a series of registered receivers in
    order of priority as declared by the Receivers. A malicious receiver can give
    itself a high priority and cause a denial of service by stopping the broadcast
    from propagating further down the chain. There is also the possibility of malicious
    data modification, as a receiver may also alter the data within the Intent before
    passing it on to the next receiver. The downstream components have no way of asserting
    that the data has not been altered earlier in the chain. Sticky broadcast intents
    remain accessible after the initial broadcast. An old sticky intent will be broadcast
    again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing
    the chances of information exposure over time. Also, sticky broadcasts cannot
    be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents. In addition,
    any broadcast intent may include a URI that references data that the receiving
    component does not normally have the privileges to access. The sender of the intent
    can include special privileges that grant the receiver read or write access to
    the specific URI included in the intent. A malicious receiver that intercepts
    this intent will also gain those privileges and be able to read or write the resource
    at the specified URI.

CWE-939:
  name: Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme
  description: Mobile platforms and other architectures allow the use of custom URL
    schemes to facilitate communication between applications. In the case of iOS,
    this is the only method to do inter-application communication. The implementation
    is at the developer's discretion which may open security flaws in the application.
    An example could be potentially dangerous functionality such as modifying files
    through a custom URL scheme.

  name: Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel
  description: When an attacker can successfully establish a communication channel
    from an untrusted origin, the attacker may be able to gain privileges and access
    unexpected functionality.
  id: CWE-940
CWE-941:
  name: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
  description: 'Attackers at the destination may be able to spoof trusted servers
    to steal data or cause a denial of service. There are at least two distinct weaknesses
    that can cause the product to communicate with an unintended destination: If the
    product allows an attacker to control which destination is specified, then the
    attacker can cause it to connect to an untrusted or malicious destination. For
    example, because UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP packets can be spoofed
    by specifying a false source address in the packet; when the server receives the
    packet and sends a reply, it will specify a destination by using the source of
    the incoming packet - i.e., the false source. The server can then be tricked into
    sending traffic to the wrong host, which is effective for hiding the real source
    of an attack and for conducting a distributed denial of service (DDoS). As another
    example, server-side request forgery (SSRF) and XML External Entity (XXE) can
    be used to trick a server into making outgoing requests to hosts that cannot be
    directly accessed by the attacker due to firewall restrictions. If the product
    incorrectly specifies the destination, then an attacker who can control this destination
    might be able to spoof trusted servers. While the most common occurrence is likely
    due to misconfiguration by an administrator, this can be resultant from other
    weaknesses. For example, the product might incorrectly parse an e-mail or IP address
    and send sensitive data to an unintended destination. As another example, an Android
    application may use a sticky broadcast to communicate with a receiver for a particular
    application, but since sticky broadcasts can be processed by *any* receiver, this
    can allow a malicious application to access restricted data that was only intended
    for a different application.'
  id: CWE-941
CWE-942:
  name: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains
  description: A cross-domain policy file (crossdomain.xml in Flash and clientaccesspolicy.xml
    in Silverlight) defines a list of domains from which a server is allowed to make
    cross-domain requests. When making a cross-domain request, the Flash or Silverlight
    client will first look for the policy file on the target server. If it is found,
    and the domain hosting the application is explicitly allowed to make requests,
    the request is made. Therefore, if a cross-domain policy file includes domains
    that should not be trusted, such as when using wildcards, then the application
    could be attacked by these untrusted domains. An overly permissive policy file
    allows many of the same attacks seen in Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79). Once the
    user has executed a malicious Flash or Silverlight application, they are vulnerable
    to a variety of attacks. The attacker could transfer private information, such
    as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to
    the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf
    of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has
    administrator privileges to manage that site. In many cases, the attack can be
    launched without the victim even being aware of it.

CWE-943:
  name: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic
  description: 'Depending on the capabilities of the query language, an attacker could
    inject additional logic into the query to: Modify the intended selection criteria,
    thus changing which data entities (e.g., records) are returned, modified, or otherwise
    manipulated Append additional commands to the query Return more entities than
    intended Return fewer entities than intended Cause entities to be sorted in an
    unexpected way The ability to execute additional commands or change which entities
    are returned has obvious risks. But when the product logic depends on the order
    or number of entities, this can also lead to vulnerabilities. For example, if
    the query expects to return only one entity that specifies an administrative user,
    but an attacker can change which entities are returned, this could cause the logic
    to return information for a regular user and incorrectly assume that the user
    has administrative privileges. While this weakness is most commonly associated
    with SQL injection, there are many other query languages that are also subject
    to injection attacks, including HTSQL, LDAP, DQL, XQuery, Xpath, and NoSQL languages.'

    response header helps mitigate the risk associated with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    where an attacker's script code might attempt to read the contents of a cookie

CWE-1007:
  name: Insufficient Visual Distinction of Homoglyphs Presented to User
  description: Some glyphs, pictures, or icons can be semantically distinct to a program,
    while appearing very similar or identical to a human user. These are referred
    to as homoglyphs. For example, the lowercase l (ell) and uppercase I (eye) have
    different character codes, but these characters can be displayed in exactly the
    same way to a user, depending on the font. This can also occur between different
    character sets. For example, the Latin capital letter A and the Greek capital
    letter Α (Alpha) are treated as distinct by programs, but may be displayed in
    exactly the same way to a user. Accent marks may also cause letters to appear
    very similar, such as the Latin capital letter grave mark À and its equivalent
    Á with the acute accent. Adversaries can exploit this visual similarity for attacks
    such as phishing, e.g. by providing a link to an attacker-controlled hostname
    that looks like a hostname that the victim trusts. In a different use of homoglyphs,
    an adversary may create a back door username that is visually similar to the username
    of a regular user, which then makes it more difficult for a system administrator
    to detect the malicious username while reviewing logs.

  description: When a user clicks a link to an external site (target), the target=_blank

    which runs in the same process as the original page. The window.opener object
    records information about the original page that offered the link. If an attacker
    can run script on the target page, then they could read or modify certain properties
    of the window.opener object, including the location property - even if the original
    and target site are not the same origin. An attacker can modify the location property
    to automatically redirect the user to a malicious site, e.g. as part of a phishing
    attack. Since this redirect happens in the original window/tab - which is not
    necessarily visible, since the browser is focusing the display on the new target
    page - the user might not notice any suspicious redirection.

CWE-1059:
  name: Insufficient Technical Documentation
  description: When technical documentation is limited or lacking, products are more
    difficult to maintain. This indirectly affects security by making it more difficult
    or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. When using time-limited
    or labor-limited third-party/in-house security consulting services (such as threat
    modeling, vulnerability discovery, or pentesting), insufficient documentation
    can force those consultants to invest unnecessary time in learning how the product
    is organized, instead of focusing their expertise on finding the flaws or suggesting
    effective mitigations. With respect to hardware design, the lack of a formal,
    final manufacturer reference can make it difficult or impossible to evaluate the
    final product, including post-manufacture verification. One cannot ensure that
    design functionality or operation is within acceptable tolerances, conforms to
    specifications, and is free from unexpected behavior. Hardware-related documentation
    may include engineering artifacts such as hardware description language (HDLs),
    netlists, Gerber files, Bills of Materials, EDA (Electronic Design Automation)
    tool files, etc.

    or method definitions, exception handlers, etc. While an empty code block might
    be intentional, it might also indicate incomplete implementation, accidental code
    deletion, unexpected macro expansion, etc. For some programming languages and
    constructs, an empty block might be allowed by the syntax, but the lack of any
    behavior within the block might violate a convention or API in such a way that
    it is an error.

  name: Excessive Attack Surface
  description: Originating from software security, an attack surface measure typically
    reflects the number of input points and output points that can be utilized by
    an untrusted party, i.e. a potential attacker. A larger attack surface provides
    more places to attack, and more opportunities for developers to introduce weaknesses.

CWE-1173:
  name: Improper Use of Validation Framework
  description: Many modern coding languages provide developers with input validation
    frameworks to make the task of input validation easier and less error-prone. These
    frameworks will automatically check all input against specified criteria and direct
    execution to error handlers when invalid input is received. The improper use (i.e.,
    an incorrect implementation or missing altogether) of these frameworks is not
    directly exploitable, but can lead to an exploitable condition if proper input
    validation is not performed later in the product. Not using provided input validation
    frameworks can also hurt the maintainability of code as future developers may
    not recognize the downstream input validation being used in the place of the validation
    framework.

    real or suspected vulnerabilities; difficulty to use securely; export controls
    or license requirements; obsolete or poorly-maintained code; internal code being
    scheduled for deprecation; etc. To reduce risk of vulnerabilities, the developer
    might maintain a list of banned functions that programmers must avoid using because
    the functions are difficult or impossible to use securely. This issue can also
    make the product more costly and difficult to maintain.

  description: Developers often choose default values that leave the product as open
    and easy to use as possible out-of-the-box, under the assumption that the administrator

  name: Improper Isolation of Shared Resources on System-on-a-Chip (SoC)
  description: A System-On-a-Chip (SoC) has a lot of functionality, but it may have
    a limited number of pins or pads. A pin can only perform one function at a time.
    However, it can be configured to perform multiple different functions. This technique
    is called pin multiplexing. Similarly, several resources on the chip may be shared
    to multiplex and support different features or functions. When such resources
    are shared between trusted and untrusted agents, untrusted agents may be able
    to access the assets intended to be accessed only by the trusted agents.

CWE-1190:
  name: DMA Device Enabled Too Early in Boot Phase
  description: DMA is included in a number of devices because it allows data transfer
    between the computer and the connected device, using direct hardware access to
    read or write directly to main memory without any OS interaction. An attacker
    could exploit this to access secrets. Several virtualization-based mitigations
    have been introduced to thwart DMA attacks. These are usually configured/setup
    during boot time. However, certain IPs that are powered up before boot is complete
    (known as early boot IPs) may be DMA capable. Such IPs, if not trusted, could
    launch DMA attacks and gain access to assets that should otherwise be protected.
  id: CWE-1190
CWE-1191:
  name: On-Chip Debug and Test Interface With Improper Access Control
  description: A device's internal information may be accessed through a scan chain
    of interconnected internal registers, usually through a JTAG interface. The JTAG
    interface provides access to these registers in a serial fashion in the form of
    a scan chain for the purposes of debugging programs running on a device. Since
    almost all information contained within a device may be accessed over this interface,
    device manufacturers typically insert some form of authentication and authorization
    to prevent unintended use of this sensitive information. This mechanism is implemented
    in addition to on-chip protections that are already present. If authorization,
    authentication, or some other form of access control is not implemented or not
    implemented correctly, a user may be able to bypass on-chip protection mechanisms
    through the debug interface. Sometimes, designers choose not to expose the debug
    pins on the motherboard. Instead, they choose to hide these pins in the intermediate
    layers of the board. This is primarily done to work around the lack of debug authorization
    inside the chip. In such a scenario (without debug authorization), when the debug
    interface is exposed, chip internals are accessible to an attacker.

CWE-1192:
  name: Improper Identifier for IP Block used in System-On-Chip (SOC)
  description: 'A System-on-Chip (SoC) comprises several components (IP) with varied
    trust requirements. It is required that each IP is identified uniquely and should
    distinguish itself from other entities in the SoC without any ambiguity. The unique
    secured identity is required for various purposes. Most of the time the identity
    is used to route a transaction or perform certain actions, including resetting,
    retrieving a sensitive information, and acting upon or on behalf of something
    else. There are several variants of this weakness: A missing identifier is when
    the SoC does not define any mechanism to uniquely identify the IP. An insufficient
    identifier might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common
    attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. A misconfigured
    mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available but not implemented correctly.
    An ignored identifier occurs when the SoC/IP has not applied any policies or does
    not act upon the identifier securely.'

  description: After initial reset, System-on-Chip (SoC) fabric access controls and
    other security features need to be programmed by trusted firmware as part of the
    boot sequence. If untrusted IPs or peripheral microcontrollers are enabled first,
    then the untrusted component can master transactions on the hardware bus and target

  name: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)
  description: By design, some cryptographic primitives (such as block ciphers) require
    that IVs must have certain properties for the uniqueness and/or unpredictability
    of an IV. Primitives may vary in how important these properties are. If these
    properties are not maintained, e.g. by a bug in the code, then the cryptography

  description: Reserved bits are labeled as such so they can be allocated for a later
    purpose. They are not to do anything in the current design. However, designers
    might want to use these bits to debug or control/configure a future capability
    to help minimize time to market (TTM). If the logic being controlled by these
    bits is still enabled in production, an adversary could use the logic to induce
    unwanted/unsupported behavior in the hardware.
  id: CWE-1209
CWE-1220:
  name: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
  description: Integrated circuits and hardware engines can expose accesses to assets
    (device configuration, keys, etc.) to trusted firmware or a software module (commonly
    set by BIOS/bootloader). This access is typically access-controlled. Upon a power
    reset, the hardware or system usually starts with default values in registers,
    and the trusted firmware (Boot firmware) configures the necessary access-control
    protection. A common weakness that can exist in such protection schemes is that
    access controls or policies are not granular enough. This condition allows agents
    beyond trusted agents to access assets and could lead to a loss of functionality
    or the ability to set up the device securely. This further results in security
    risks from leaked, sensitive, key material to modification of device configuration.
  id: CWE-1220
CWE-1221:
  name: Incorrect Register Defaults or Module Parameters
  description: Integrated circuits and hardware IP software programmable controls
    and settings are commonly stored in register circuits. These register contents
    have to be initialized at hardware reset to defined default values that are hard
    coded in the hardware description language (HDL) code of the hardware unit. Hardware
    descriptive languages also support definition of parameter variables, which can
    be defined in code during instantiation of the hardware IP module. Such parameters
    are generally used to configure a specific instance of a hardware IP in the design.
    The system security settings of a hardware design can be affected by incorrectly
    defined default values or IP parameters. The hardware IP would be in an insecure
    state at power reset, and this can be exposed or exploited by untrusted software
    running on the system. Both register defaults and parameters are hardcoded values,
    which cannot be changed using software or firmware patches but must be changed
    in hardware silicon. Thus, such security issues are considerably more difficult
    to address later in the lifecycle. Hardware designs can have a large number of
    such parameters and register defaults settings, and it is important to have design
    tool support to check these settings in an automated way and be able to identify
    which settings are security sensitive.
  id: CWE-1221
CWE-1222:
  name: Insufficient Granularity of Address Regions Protected by Register Locks
  description: Integrated circuits and hardware IPs can expose the device configuration
    controls that need to be programmed after device power reset by a trusted firmware
    or software module (commonly set by BIOS/bootloader) and then locked from any
    further modification. In hardware design, this is commonly implemented using a
    programmable lock bit which enables/disables writing to a protected set of registers
    or address regions. When the programmable lock bit is set, the relevant address
    region can be implemented as a hardcoded value in hardware logic that cannot be
    changed later. A problem can arise wherein the protected region definition is
    not granular enough. After the programmable lock bit has been set, then this new
    functionality cannot be implemented without change to the hardware design.
  id: CWE-1222
CWE-1223:
  name: Race Condition for Write-Once Attributes
  description: Integrated circuits and hardware IP software programmable controls
    and settings are commonly stored in register circuits. These register contents
    have to be initialized at hardware reset to defined default values that are hard
    coded in the hardware description language (HDL) code of the hardware unit. A
    common security protection method used to protect register settings from modification
    by software is to make them write-once. This means the hardware implementation
    only allows writing to such registers once, and they become read-only after having
    been written once by software. This is useful to allow initial boot software to
    configure systems settings to secure values while blocking runtime software from
    modifying such hardware settings. Implementation issues in hardware design of
    such controls can expose such registers to a race condition security flaw. For
    example, consider a hardware design that has two different software/firmware modules
    executing in parallel. One module is trusted (module A) and another is untrusted
    (module B). In this design it could be possible for Module B to send write cycles
    to the write-once register before Module A. Since the field is write-once the
    programmed value from Module A will be ignored and the pre-empted value programmed
    by Module B will be used by hardware.
  id: CWE-1223
CWE-1224:
  name: Improper Restriction of Write-Once Bit Fields
  description: Integrated circuits and hardware IP software programmable controls
    and settings are commonly stored in register circuits. These register contents
    have to be initialized at hardware reset to define default values that are hard
    coded in the hardware description language (HDL) code of the hardware unit. A
    common security protection method used to protect register settings from modification
    by software is to make the settings write-once or sticky. This allows writing
    to such registers only once, whereupon they become read-only. This is useful to
    allow initial boot software to configure systems settings to secure values while
    blocking runtime software from modifying such hardware settings. Failure to implement
    write-once restrictions in hardware design can expose such registers to being
    re-programmed by software and written multiple times. For example, write-once
    fields could be implemented to only be write-protected if they have been set to
    value 1, wherein they would work as write-1-once and not write-once.

  name: Creation of Emergent Resource
  description: A product is only expected to behave in a way that was specifically
    intended by the developer. Resource allocation and management is expected to be
    performed explicitly by the associated code. However, in systems with complex
    behavior, the product might indirectly produce new kinds of resources that were
    never intended in the original design. For example, a covert channel is a resource
    that was never explicitly intended by the developer, but it is useful to attackers.
    Parasitic computing, while not necessarily malicious in nature, effectively tricks
    a product into performing unintended computations on behalf of another party.

CWE-1230:
  name: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Metadata
  description: Developers might correctly prevent unauthorized access to a database
    or other resource containing sensitive information, but they might not consider
    that portions of the original information might also be recorded in metadata,
    search indices, statistical reports, or other resources. If these resources are
    not also restricted, then attackers might be able to extract some or all of the
    original information, or otherwise infer some details. For example, an attacker
    could specify search terms that are known to be unique to a particular person,
    or view metadata such as activity or creation dates in order to identify usage
    patterns.
  id: CWE-1230
CWE-1231:
  name: Improper Prevention of Lock Bit Modification
  description: In integrated circuits and hardware intellectual property (IP) cores,
    device configuration controls are commonly programmed after a device power reset
    by a trusted firmware or software module (e.g., BIOS/bootloader) and then locked
    from any further modification. This behavior is commonly implemented using a trusted
    lock bit. When set, the lock bit disables writes to a protected set of registers
    or address regions. Design or coding errors in the implementation of the lock
    bit protection feature may allow the lock bit to be modified or cleared by software
    after it has been set. Attackers might be able to unlock the system and features
    that the bit is intended to protect.
  id: CWE-1231
CWE-1232:
  name: Improper Lock Behavior After Power State Transition
  description: Devices may allow device configuration controls which need to be programmed
    after device power reset via a trusted firmware or software module (commonly set
    by BIOS/bootloader) and then locked from any further modification. This action
    is commonly implemented using a programmable lock bit, which, when set, disables
    writes to a protected set of registers or address regions. After a power state
    transition, the lock bit is set to unlocked. Some common weaknesses that can exist
    in such a protection scheme are that the lock gets cleared, the values of the
    protected registers get reset, or the lock become programmable.
  id: CWE-1232
CWE-1233:
  name: Security-Sensitive Hardware Controls with Missing Lock Bit Protection
  description: Integrated circuits and hardware intellectual properties (IPs) might
    provide device configuration controls that need to be programmed after device
    power reset by a trusted firmware or software module, commonly set by BIOS/bootloader.
    After reset, there can be an expectation that the controls cannot be used to perform
    any further modification. This behavior is commonly implemented using a trusted
    lock bit, which can be set to disable writes to a protected set of registers or
    address regions. The lock protection is intended to prevent modification of certain
    system configuration (e.g., memory/memory protection unit configuration). However,
    if the lock bit does not effectively write-protect all system registers or controls
    that could modify the protected system configuration, then an adversary may be
    able to use software to access the registers/controls and modify the protected
    hardware configuration.
  id: CWE-1233
CWE-1234:
  name: Hardware Internal or Debug Modes Allow Override of Locks
  description: Device configuration controls are commonly programmed after a device
    power reset by a trusted firmware or software module (e.g., BIOS/bootloader) and
    then locked from any further modification. This is commonly implemented using
    a trusted lock bit, which when set, disables writes to a protected set of registers
    or address regions. The lock protection is intended to prevent modification of
    certain system configuration (e.g., memory/memory protection unit configuration).
    If debug features supported by hardware or internal modes/system states are supported
    in the hardware design, modification of the lock protection may be allowed allowing
    access and modification of configuration information.

CWE-1235:
  name: Incorrect Use of Autoboxing and Unboxing for Performance Critical Operations
  description: Languages such as Java and C# support automatic conversion through
    their respective compilers from primitive types into objects of the corresponding
    wrapper classes, and vice versa. For example, a compiler might convert an int
    to Integer (called autoboxing) or an Integer to int (called unboxing). This eliminates
    forcing the programmer to perform these conversions manually, which makes the
    code cleaner. However, this feature comes at a cost of performance and can lead
    to resource exhaustion and impact availability when used with generic collections.
    Therefore, they should not be used for scientific computing or other performance
    critical operations. They are only suited to support impedance mismatch between
    reference types and primitives.

  description: User-provided data is often saved to traditional databases. This data
    can be exported to a CSV file, which allows users to read the data using spreadsheet
    software such as Excel, Numbers, or Calc. This software interprets entries beginning
    with '=' as formulas, which are then executed by the spreadsheet software. The
    software's formula language often allows methods to access hyperlinks or the local
    command line, and frequently allows enough characters to invoke an entire script.
    Attackers can populate data fields which, when saved to a CSV file, may attempt
    information exfiltration or other malicious activity when automatically executed
    by the spreadsheet software.
  id: CWE-1236
CWE-1239:
  name: Improper Zeroization of Hardware Register
  description: Hardware logic operates on data stored in registers local to the hardware
    block. Most hardware IPs, including cryptographic accelerators, rely on registers
    to buffer I/O, store intermediate values, and interface with software. The result
    of this is that sensitive information, such as passwords or encryption keys, can
    exist in locations not transparent to the user of the hardware logic. When a different
    entity obtains access to the IP due to a change in operating mode or conditions,
    the new entity can extract information belonging to the previous user if no mechanisms
    are in place to clear register contents. It is important to clear information
    stored in the hardware if a physical attack on the product is detected, or if
    the user of the hardware block changes. The process of clearing register contents
    in a hardware IP is referred to as zeroization in standards for cryptographic
    hardware modules such as FIPS-140-2 [REF-267].
  id: CWE-1239
CWE-1240:
  name: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation
  description: Cryptographic protocols and systems depend on cryptographic primitives
    (and associated algorithms) as their basic building blocks. Some common examples
    of primitives are digital signatures, one-way hash functions, ciphers, and public
    key cryptography; however, the notion of primitive can vary depending on point
    of view. See Terminology Notes for further explanation of some concepts. Cryptographic
    primitives are defined to accomplish one very specific task in a precisely defined
    and mathematically reliable fashion. For example, suppose that for a specific
    cryptographic primitive (such as an encryption routine), the consensus is that
    the primitive can only be broken after trying out N different inputs (where the
    larger the value of N, the stronger the cryptography). For an encryption scheme
    like AES-256, one would expect N to be so large as to be infeasible to execute
    in a reasonable amount of time. If a vulnerability is ever found that shows that
    one can break a cryptographic primitive in significantly less than the expected
    number of attempts, then that primitive is considered weakened (or sometimes in
    extreme cases, colloquially it is broken). As a result, anything using this cryptographic
    primitive would now be considered insecure or risky. Thus, even breaking or weakening
    a seemingly small cryptographic primitive has the potential to render the whole
    system vulnerable, due to its reliance on the primitive. A historical example
    can be found in TLS when using DES. One would colloquially call DES the cryptographic
    primitive for transport encryption in this version of TLS. In the past, DES was
    considered strong, because no weaknesses were found in it; importantly, DES has
    a key length of 56 bits. Trying N=2^56 keys was considered impractical for most
    actors. Unfortunately, attacking a system with 56-bit keys is now practical via
    brute force, which makes defeating DES encryption practical. It is now practical
    for an adversary to read any information sent under this version of TLS and use
    this information to attack the system. As a result, it can be claimed that this
    use of TLS is weak, and that any system depending on TLS with DES could potentially
    render the entire system vulnerable to attack. Cryptographic primitives and associated
    algorithms are only considered safe after extensive research and review from experienced
    cryptographers from academia, industry, and government entities looking for any
    possible flaws. Furthermore, cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms
    are frequently reevaluated for safety when new mathematical and attack techniques
    are discovered. As a result and over time, even well-known cryptographic primitives
    can lose their compliance status with the discovery of novel attacks that might
    either defeat the algorithm or reduce its robustness significantly. If ad-hoc
    cryptographic primitives are implemented, it is almost certain that the implementation
    will be vulnerable to attacks that are well understood by cryptographers, resulting
    in the exposure of sensitive information and other consequences. This weakness
    is even more difficult to manage for hardware-implemented deployment of cryptographic
    algorithms. First, because hardware is not patchable as easily as software, any
    flaw discovered after release and production typically cannot be fixed without
    a recall of the product. Secondly, the hardware product is often expected to work
    for years, during which time computation power available to the attacker only
    increases. Therefore, for hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives,
    it is absolutely essential that only strong, proven cryptographic primitives are
    used.

CWE-1241:
  name: Use of Predictable Algorithm in Random Number Generator
  description: Pseudo-random number generator algorithms are predictable because their
    registers have a finite number of possible states, which eventually lead to repeating
    patterns. As a result, pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) can compromise
    their randomness or expose their internal state to various attacks, such as reverse
    engineering or tampering. It is highly recommended to use hardware-based true
    random number generators (TRNGs) to ensure the security of encryption schemes.
    TRNGs generate unpredictable, unbiased, and independent random numbers because
    they employ physical phenomena, e.g., electrical noise, as sources to generate

    of faulty components, features that negatively affect performance, or features
    that do not provide the required controllability for debug and test. Another way
    to achieve this is through implementation of undocumented features. An attacker

    data. After the chip is powered on, these values are sensed from fuses and stored
    in temporary locations such as registers and local memories. These locations are
    typically access-control protected from untrusted agents capable of accessing
    them. Even to trusted agents, only read-access is provided. However, these locations
    are not blocked during debug operations, allowing a user to access this sensitive
    information.

CWE-1244:
  name: Internal Asset Exposed to Unsafe Debug Access Level or State
  description: Debug authorization can have multiple levels of access, defined such
    that different system internal assets are accessible based on the current authorized
    debug level. Other than debugger authentication (e.g., using passwords or challenges),
    the authorization can also be based on the system state or boot stage. For example,
    full system debug access might only be allowed early in boot after a system reset
    to ensure that previous session data is not accessible to the authenticated debugger.
    If this protection mechanism does not ensure that internal assets have the correct
    debug access level during each boot stage or change in system state, an attacker
    could obtain sensitive information from the internal asset using a debugger.

CWE-1245:
  name: Improper Finite State Machines (FSMs) in Hardware Logic
  description: The functionality and security of the system heavily depend on the
    implementation of FSMs. FSMs can be used to indicate the current security state
    of the system. Lots of secure data operations and data transfers rely on the state
    reported by the FSM. Faulty FSM designs that do not account for all states, either
    through undefined states (left as don't cares) or through incorrect implementation,
    might lead an attacker to drive the system into an unstable state from which the
    system cannot recover without a reset, thus causing a DoS. Depending on what the
    FSM is used for, an attacker might also gain additional privileges to launch further
    attacks and compromise the security guarantees.

CWE-1246:
  name: Improper Write Handling in Limited-write Non-Volatile Memories
  description: Non-volatile memories such as NAND Flash, EEPROM, etc. have individually
    erasable segments, each of which can be put through a limited number of program/erase
    or write cycles. For example, the device can only endure a limited number of writes,
    after which the device becomes unreliable. In order to wear out the cells in a
    uniform manner, non-volatile memory and storage products based on the above-mentioned
    technologies implement a technique called wear leveling. Once a set threshold
    is reached, wear leveling maps writes of a logical block to a different physical
    block. This prevents a single physical block from prematurely failing due to a
    high concentration of writes. If wear leveling is improperly implemented, attackers
    may be able to programmatically cause the storage to become unreliable within
    a much shorter time than would normally be expected.
  id: CWE-1246
CWE-1247:
  name: Improper Protection Against Voltage and Clock Glitches
  description: A device might support features such as secure boot which are supplemented
    with hardware and firmware support. This involves establishing a chain of trust,
    starting with an immutable root of trust by checking the signature of the next
    stage (culminating with the OS and runtime software) against a golden value before
    transferring control. The intermediate stages typically set up the system in a
    secure state by configuring several access control settings. Similarly, security
    logic for exercising a debug or testing interface may be implemented in hardware,
    firmware, or both. A device needs to guard against fault attacks such as voltage
    glitches and clock glitches that an attacker may employ in an attempt to compromise
    the system.

CWE-1248:
  name: Semiconductor Defects in Hardware Logic with Security-Sensitive Implications
  description: A semiconductor device can fail for various reasons. While some are
    manufacturing and packaging defects, the rest are due to prolonged use or usage
    under extreme conditions. Some mechanisms that lead to semiconductor defects include
    encapsulation failure, die-attach failure, wire-bond failure, bulk-silicon defects,
    oxide-layer faults, aluminum-metal faults (including electromigration, corrosion
    of aluminum, etc.), and thermal/electrical stress. These defects manifest as faults
    on chip-internal signals or registers, have the effect of inputs, outputs, or
    intermediate signals being always 0 or always 1, and do not switch as expected.
    If such faults occur in security-sensitive hardware modules, the security objectives
    of the hardware module may be compromised.

CWE-1249:
  name: Application-Level Admin Tool with Inconsistent View of Underlying Operating
    System
  description: 'Many products provide web-based applications or other interfaces for
    managing the underlying operating system. This is common with cloud, network access
    devices, home networking, and other systems. When the management tool does not
    accurately represent what is in the OS - such as user accounts - then the administrator
    might not see suspicious activities that would be noticed otherwise. For example,
    numerous systems utilize a web front-end for administrative control. They also
    offer the ability to add, alter, and drop users with various privileges as it
    relates to the functionality of the system. A potential architectural weakness
    may exist where the user information reflected in the web interface does not mirror
    the users in the underlying operating system. Many web UI or REST APIs use the
    underlying operating system for authentication; the system''s logic may also track
    an additional set of user capabilities within configuration files and datasets
    for authorization capabilities. When there is a discrepancy between the user information
    in the UI or REST API''s interface system and the underlying operating system''s
    user listing, this may introduce a weakness into the system. For example, if an
    attacker compromises the OS and adds a new user account - a ghost account - then
    the attacker could escape detection if the management tool does not list the newly-added
    account. This discrepancy could be exploited in several ways: A rogue admin could
    insert a new account into a system that will persist if they are terminated or
    wish to take action on a system that cannot be directly associated with them.
    An attacker can leverage a separate command injection attack available through
    the web interface to insert a ghost account with shell privileges such as ssh.
    An attacker can leverage existing web interface APIs, manipulated in such a way
    that a new user is inserted into the operating system, and the user web account
    is either partially created or not at all. An attacker could create an admin account
    which is viewable by an administrator, use this account to create the ghost account,
    delete logs and delete the first created admin account. Many of these attacker
    scenarios can be realized by leveraging separate vulnerabilities related to XSS,
    command injection, authentication bypass, or logic flaws on the various systems.'

CWE-1250:
  name: Improper Preservation of Consistency Between Independent Representations of
    Shared State
  description: In highly distributed environments, or on systems with distinct physical
    components that operate independently, there is often a need for each component
    to store and update its own local copy of key data such as state or cache, so
    that all components have the same view of the overall system and operate in a
    coordinated fashion. For example, users of a social media service or a massively
    multiplayer online game might be using their own personal computers while also
    interacting with different physical hosts in a globally distributed service, but
    all participants must be able to have the same view of the world. Alternately,
    a processor's Memory Management Unit (MMU) might have shadow MMUs to distribute
    its workload, and all shadow MMUs are expected to have the same accessible ranges
    of memory. In such environments, it becomes critical for the product to ensure
    that this shared state is consistently modified across all distributed systems.
    If state is not consistently maintained across all systems, then critical transactions
    might take place out of order, or some users might not get the same data as other
    users. When this inconsistency affects correctness of operations, it can introduce
    vulnerabilities in mechanisms that depend on consistent state.
  id: CWE-1250
CWE-1251:
  name: Mirrored Regions with Different Values
  description: 'Having mirrored regions with different values might result in the
    exposure of sensitive information or possibly system compromise. In the interest
    of increased performance, one might need to duplicate a resource. A cache memory
    is a common example of this concept, which keeps a local copy of a data element
    in the high speed cache memory. Unfortunately, this speed improvement comes with
    a downside, since the product needs to ensure that the local copy always mirrors
    the original copy truthfully. If they get out of sync, the computational result
    is no longer true. During hardware design, memory is not the only item which gets
    mirrored. There are many other entities that get mirrored, as well: registers,
    memory regions, and, in some cases, even whole computational units. For example,
    within a multi-core processor, if all memory accesses for each and every core
    goes through a single Memory-Management Unit (MMU) then the MMU will become a
    performance bottleneck. In such cases, duplicating local MMUs that will serve
    only a subset of the cores rather than all of them may resolve the performance
    issue. These local copies are also called shadow copies or mirrored copies. If
    the original resource never changed, local duplicate copies getting out of sync
    would never be an issue. However, the values of the original copy will sometimes
    change. When the original copy changes, the mirrored copies must also change,
    and change fast. This situation of shadow-copy-possibly-out-of-sync-with-original-copy
    might occur as a result of multiple scenarios, including the following: After
    the values in the original copy change, due to some reason the original copy does
    not send the update request to its shadow copies. After the values in the original
    copy change, the original copy dutifully sends the update request to its shadow
    copies, but due to some reason the shadow copy does not execute this update request.
    After the values in the original copy change, the original copy sends the update
    request to its shadow copies, and the shadow copy executes this update request
    faithfully. However, during the small time period when the original copy has new
    values and the shadow copy is still holding the old values, an attacker can exploit
    the old values. Then it becomes a race condition between the attacker and the
    update process of who can reach the target, shadow copy first, and, if the attacker
    reaches first, the attacker wins. The attacker might send a spoofed update request
    to the target shadow copy, pretending that this update request is coming from
    the original copy. This spoofed request might cause the targeted shadow copy to
    update its values to some attacker-friendly values, while the original copies
    remain unchanged by the attacker. Suppose a situation where the original copy
    has a system of reverting back to its original value if it does not hear back
    from all the shadow copies that such copies have successfully completed the update
    request. In such a case, an attack might occur as follows: (1) the original copy
    might send an update request; (2) the shadow copy updates it; (3) the shadow copy
    sends back the successful completion message; (4) through a separate issue, the
    attacker is able to intercept the shadow copy''s completion message. In this case,
    the original copy thinks that the update did not succeed, hence it reverts to
    its original value. Now there is a situation where the original copy has the old
    value, and the shadow copy has the new value.'

CWE-1252:
  name: CPU Hardware Not Configured to Support Exclusivity of Write and Execute Operations
  description: CPUs provide a special bit that supports exclusivity of write and execute
    operations. This bit is used to segregate areas of memory to either mark them
    as code (instructions, which can be executed) or data (which should not be executed).
    In this way, if a user can write to a region of memory, the user cannot execute
    from that region and vice versa. This exclusivity provided by special hardware
    bit is leveraged by the operating system to protect executable space. While this
    bit is available in most modern processors by default, in some CPUs the exclusivity
    is implemented via a memory-protection unit (MPU) and memory-management unit (MMU)
    in which memory regions can be carved out with exact read, write, and execute
    permissions. However, if the CPU does not have an MMU/MPU, then there is no write
    exclusivity. Without configuring exclusivity of operations via segregated areas
    of memory, an attacker may be able to inject malicious code onto memory and later
    execute it.

CWE-1253:
  name: Incorrect Selection of Fuse Values
  description: Fuses are often used to store secret data, including security configuration
    data. When not blown, a fuse is considered to store a logic 0, and, when blown,
    it indicates a logic 1. Fuses are generally considered to be one-directional,
    i.e., once blown to logic 1, it cannot be reset to logic 0. However, if the logic
    used to determine system-security state (by leveraging the values sensed from
    the fuses) uses negative logic, an attacker might blow the fuse and drive the
    system to an insecure state.

CWE-1254:
  name: Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity
  description: Comparison logic is used to compare a variety of objects including
    passwords, Message Authentication Codes (MACs), and responses to verification
    challenges. When comparison logic is implemented at a finer granularity (e.g.,
    byte-by-byte comparison) and breaks in the case of a comparison failure, an attacker
    can exploit this implementation to identify when exactly the failure occurred.
    With multiple attempts, the attacker may be able to guesses the correct password/response
    to challenge and elevate their privileges.

CWE-1255:
  name: Comparison Logic is Vulnerable to Power Side-Channel Attacks
  description: The power consumed by a device may be instrumented and monitored in
    real time. If the algorithm for evaluating security tokens is not sufficiently
    robust, the power consumption may vary by token entry comparison against the reference
    value. Further, if retries are unlimited, the power difference between a good
    entry and a bad entry may be observed and used to determine whether each entry
    itself is correct thereby allowing unauthorized parties to calculate the reference
    value.
  id: CWE-1255
CWE-1256:
  name: Improper Restriction of Software Interfaces to Hardware Features
  description: It is frequently assumed that physical attacks such as fault injection
    and side-channel analysis require an attacker to have physical access to the target
    device. This assumption may be false if the device has improperly secured power
    management features, or similar features. For mobile devices, minimizing power
    consumption is critical, but these devices run a wide variety of applications
    with different performance requirements. Software-controllable mechanisms to dynamically
    scale device voltage and frequency and monitor power consumption are common features
    in today's chipsets, but they also enable attackers to mount fault injection and
    side-channel attacks without having physical access to the device. Fault injection
    attacks involve strategic manipulation of bits in a device to achieve a desired
    effect such as skipping an authentication step, elevating privileges, or altering
    the output of a cryptographic operation. Manipulation of the device clock and
    voltage supply is a well-known technique to inject faults and is cheap to implement
    with physical device access. Poorly protected power management features allow
    these attacks to be performed from software. Other features, such as the ability
    to write repeatedly to DRAM at a rapid rate from unprivileged software, can result
    in bit flips in other memory locations (Rowhammer, [REF-1083]). Side channel analysis
    requires gathering measurement traces of physical quantities such as power consumption.
    Modern processors often include power metering capabilities in the hardware itself
    (e.g., Intel RAPL) which if not adequately protected enable attackers to gather
    measurements necessary for performing side-channel attacks from software.
  id: CWE-1256
CWE-1257:
  name: Improper Access Control Applied to Mirrored or Aliased Memory Regions
  description: Hardware product designs often need to implement memory protection
    features that enable privileged software to define isolated memory regions and
    access control (read/write) policies. Isolated memory regions can be defined on
    different memory spaces in a design (e.g. system physical address, virtual address,
    memory mapped IO). Each memory cell should be mapped and assigned a system address
    that the core software can use to read/write to that memory. It is possible to
    map the same memory cell to multiple system addresses such that read/write to
    any of the aliased system addresses would be decoded to the same memory cell.
    This is commonly done in hardware designs for redundancy and simplifying address
    decoding logic. If one of the memory regions is corrupted or faulty, then that
    hardware can switch to using the data in the mirrored memory region. Memory aliases
    can also be created in the system address map if the address decoder unit ignores
    higher order address bits when mapping a smaller address region into the full
    system address. A common security weakness that can exist in such memory mapping
    is that aliased memory regions could have different read/write access protections
    enforced by the hardware such that an untrusted agent is blocked from accessing
    a memory address but is not blocked from accessing the corresponding aliased memory
    address. Such inconsistency can then be used to bypass the access protection of
    the primary memory block and read or modify the protected memory. An untrusted
    agent could also possibly create memory aliases in the system address map for
    malicious purposes if it is able to change the mapping of an address region or
    modify memory region sizes.

  description: Security sensitive values, keys, intermediate steps of cryptographic

CWE-1259:
  name: Improper Restriction of Security Token Assignment
  description: 'Systems-On-A-Chip (Integrated circuits and hardware engines) implement
    Security Tokens to differentiate and identify which actions originated from which
    agent. These actions may be one of the directives: ''read'', ''write'', ''program'',
    ''reset'', ''fetch'', ''compute'', etc. Security Tokens are assigned to every
    agent in the System that is capable of generating an action or receiving an action
    from another agent. Multiple Security Tokens may be assigned to an agent and may
    be unique based on the agent''s trust level or allowed privileges. Since the Security
    Tokens are integral for the maintenance of security in an SoC, they need to be
    protected properly. A common weakness afflicting Security Tokens is improperly
    restricting the assignment to trusted components. Consequently, an improperly
    protected Security Token may be able to be programmed by a malicious agent (i.e.,
    the Security Token is mutable) to spoof the action as if it originated from a
    trusted agent.'
  id: CWE-1259
CWE-1260:
  name: Improper Handling of Overlap Between Protected Memory Ranges
  description: Isolated memory regions and access control (read/write) policies are
    used by hardware to protect privileged software. Software components are often
    allowed to change or remap memory region definitions in order to enable flexible
    and dynamically changeable memory management by system software. If a software
    component running at lower privilege can program a memory address region to overlap
    with other memory regions used by software running at higher privilege, privilege
    escalation may be available to attackers. The memory protection unit (MPU) logic
    can incorrectly handle such an address overlap and allow the lower-privilege software
    to read or write into the protected memory region, resulting in privilege escalation
    attack. An address overlap weakness can also be used to launch a denial of service
    attack on the higher-privilege software memory regions.

CWE-1261:
  name: Improper Handling of Single Event Upsets
  description: Technology trends such as CMOS-transistor down-sizing, use of new materials,
    and system-on-chip architectures continue to increase the sensitivity of systems
    to soft errors. These errors are random, and their causes might be internal (e.g.,
    interconnect coupling) or external (e.g., cosmic radiation). These soft errors
    are not permanent in nature and cause temporary bit flips known as single-event
    upsets (SEUs). SEUs are induced errors in circuits caused when charged particles
    lose energy by ionizing the medium through which they pass, leaving behind a wake
    of electron-hole pairs that cause temporary failures. If these failures occur
    in security-sensitive modules in a chip, it might compromise the security guarantees
    of the chip. For instance, these temporary failures could be bit flips that change
    the privilege of a regular user to root.

    protected. Selecting the correct physical protection mechanism and properly enforcing
    it through implementation and manufacturing are critical to the overall physical
    security of the product.

CWE-1264:
  name: Hardware Logic with Insecure De-Synchronization between Control and Data Channels
  description: Many high-performance on-chip bus protocols and processor data-paths
    employ separate channels for control and data to increase parallelism and maximize
    throughput. Bugs in the hardware logic that handle errors and security checks
    can make it possible for data to be forwarded before the completion of the security
    checks. If the data can propagate to a location in the hardware observable to
    an attacker, loss of data confidentiality can occur. 'Meltdown' is a concrete
    example of how de-synchronization between data and permissions checking logic
    can violate confidentiality requirements. Data loaded from a page marked as privileged
    was returned to the cpu regardless of current privilege level for performance
    reasons. The assumption was that the cpu could later remove all traces of this
    data during the handling of the illegal memory access exception, but this assumption
    was proven false as traces of the secret data were not removed from the microarchitectural

  description: In a complex product, a single function call may lead to many different
    possible code paths, some of which may involve deeply nested calls. It may be
    difficult to foresee all possible code paths that could emanate from a given function
    call. In some systems, an external actor can manipulate inputs to the system and
    thereby achieve a wide range of possible control flows. This is frequently a concern
    in products that execute scripts from untrusted sources. Examples of such products
    are web browsers and PDF readers. A weakness is present when one of the possible
    code paths resulting from a function call alters program state that the original
    caller assumes to be unchanged during the call.

  description: When a product is decommissioned - i.e., taken out of service - best
    practices or regulatory requirements may require the administrator to remove or
    overwrite sensitive data first, i.e. scrubbing. Improper scrubbing of sensitive
    data from a decommissioned device leaves that data vulnerable to acquisition by

  name: Policy Uses Obsolete Encoding
  description: Within a System-On-a-Chip (SoC), various circuits and hardware engines
    generate transactions for the purpose of accessing (read/write) assets or performing
    various actions (e.g., reset, fetch, compute, etc.). Among various types of message
    information, a typical transaction is comprised of source identity (identifying
    the originator of the transaction) and a destination identity (routing the transaction
    to the respective entity). Sometimes the transactions are qualified with a Security
    Token. This Security Token helps the destination agent decide on the set of allowed
    actions (e.g., access to an asset for reads and writes). A policy encoder is used
    to map the bus transactions to Security Tokens that in turn are used as access-controls/protection
    mechanisms. A common weakness involves using an encoding which is no longer trusted,
    i.e., an obsolete encoding.

  description: Integrated circuits and hardware engines may provide access to resources
    (device-configuration, encryption keys, etc.) belonging to trusted firmware or
    software modules (commonly set by a BIOS or a bootloader). These accesses are
    typically controlled and limited by the hardware. Hardware design access control
    is sometimes implemented using a policy. A policy defines which entity or agent
    may or may not be allowed to perform an action. When a system implements multiple
    levels of policies, a control policy may allow direct access to a resource as
    well as changes to the policies themselves. Resources that include agents in their
    control policy but not in their write policy could unintentionally allow an untrusted
    agent to insert itself in the write policy register. Inclusion in the write policy
    register could allow a malicious or misbehaving agent write access to resources.
    This action could result in security compromises including leaked information,
    leaked encryption keys, or modification of device configuration.

    (including registers and memory) Ability to change system configurations Ability
    to run hidden or private commands that are not allowed during production (as they
    expose IP). The above is by no means an exhaustive list, but it alludes to the
    greater capability and the greater state of vulnerability of a product during
    it''s preproduction or manufacturing state. Complexity increases when multiple
    parties are involved in executing the tests before the final production version.
    For example, a chipmaker might fabricate a chip and run its own preproduction
    tests, following which the chip would be delivered to the Original Equipment Manufacturer
    (OEM), who would now run a second set of different preproduction tests on the
    same chip. Only after both of these sets of activities are complete, can the overall
    manufacturing phase be called complete and have the Manufacturing Complete fuse
    blown. However, if the OEM forgets to blow the Manufacturing Complete fuse, then
    the system remains in the manufacturing stage, rendering the system both exposed

    Unlocking a device might be necessary for the purpose of troubleshooting device
    problems. For example, suppose a device contains the ability to dump the content

    the debug capabilities are not available. For cases where the chip designer, chip
    manufacturer (fabricator), and manufacturing and assembly testers are all employed
    by the same company, the risk of compromise of the credentials is greatly reduced.
    However, the risk is greater when the chip designer is employed by one company,
    the chip manufacturer is employed by another company (a foundry), and the assemblers
    and testers are employed by yet a third company. Since these different companies
    will need to perform various tests on the device to verify correct device function,
    they all need to share the unlock key. Unfortunately, the level of secrecy and
    policy might be quite different at each company, greatly increasing the risk of
    sensitive credentials being compromised.

CWE-1274:
  name: Improper Access Control for Volatile Memory Containing Boot Code
  description: Adversaries could bypass the secure-boot process and execute their
    own untrusted, malicious boot code. As a part of a secure-boot process, the read-only-memory
    (ROM) code for a System-on-Chip (SoC) or other system fetches bootloader code
    from Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) and stores the code in Volatile Memory (VM), such
    as dynamic, random-access memory (DRAM) or static, random-access memory (SRAM).
    The NVM is usually external to the SoC, while the VM is internal to the SoC. As
    the code is transferred from NVM to VM, it is authenticated by the SoC's ROM code.
    If the volatile-memory-region protections or access controls are insufficient
    to prevent modifications from an adversary or untrusted agent, the secure boot
    may be bypassed or replaced with the execution of an adversary's code.

CWE-1275:
  name: Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute
  description: 'The SameSite attribute controls how cookies are sent for cross-domain
    requests. This attribute may have three values: ''Lax'', ''Strict'', or ''None''.
    If the ''None'' value is used, a website may create a cross-domain POST HTTP request
    to another website, and the browser automatically adds cookies to this request.
    This may lead to Cross-Site-Request-Forgery (CSRF) attacks if there are no additional
    protections in place (such as Anti-CSRF tokens).'

  name: Hardware Child Block Incorrectly Connected to Parent System
  description: Individual hardware IP must communicate with the parent system in order
    for the product to function correctly and as intended. If implemented incorrectly,
    while not causing any apparent functional issues, may cause security issues. For
    example, if the IP should only be reset by a system-wide hard reset, but instead
    the reset input is connected to a software-triggered debug mode reset (which is
    also asserted during a hard reset), integrity of data inside the IP can be violated.

CWE-1277:
  name: Firmware Not Updateable
  description: Without the ability to patch or update firmware, consumers will be
    left vulnerable to exploitation of any known vulnerabilities, or any vulnerabilities
    that are discovered in the future. This can expose consumers to permanent risk
    throughout the entire lifetime of the device, which could be years or decades.
    Some external protective measures and mitigations might be employed to aid in
    preventing or reducing the risk of malicious attack, but the root weakness cannot
    be corrected.

CWE-1278:
  name: Missing Protection Against Hardware Reverse Engineering Using Integrated Circuit
    (IC) Imaging Techniques
  description: The physical structure of a device, viewed at high enough magnification,
    can reveal the information stored inside. Typical steps in IC reverse engineering
    involve removing the chip packaging (decapsulation) then using various imaging
    techniques ranging from high resolution x-ray microscopy to invasive techniques
    involving removing IC layers and imaging each layer using a scanning electron
    microscope. The goal of such activities is to recover secret keys, unique device
    identifiers, and proprietary code and circuit designs embedded in hardware that
    the attacker has been unsuccessful at accessing through other means. These secrets
    may be stored in non-volatile memory or in the circuit netlist. Memory technologies
    such as masked ROM allow easier to extraction of secrets than One-time Programmable
    (OTP) memory.

CWE-1279:
  name: Cryptographic Operations are run Before Supporting Units are Ready
  description: Many cryptographic hardware units depend upon other hardware units
    to supply information to them to produce a securely encrypted result. For example,
    a cryptographic unit that depends on an external random-number-generator (RNG)
    unit for entropy must wait until the RNG unit is producing random numbers. If
    a cryptographic unit retrieves a private encryption key from a fuse unit, the
    fuse unit must be up and running before a key may be supplied.

  name: Access Control Check Implemented After Asset is Accessed
  description: The product implements a hardware-based access control check. The asset
    should be accessible only after the check is successful. If, however, this operation
    is not atomic and the asset is accessed before the check is complete, the security
    of the system may be compromised.

CWE-1281:
  name: Sequence of Processor Instructions Leads to Unexpected Behavior
  description: If the instruction set architecture (ISA) and processor logic are not
    designed carefully and tested thoroughly, certain combinations of instructions
    may lead to locking the processor or other unexpected and undesirable behavior.
    Upon encountering unimplemented instruction opcodes or illegal instruction operands,
    the processor should throw an exception and carry on without negatively impacting
    security. However, specific combinations of legal and illegal instructions may
    cause unexpected behavior with security implications such as allowing unprivileged
    programs to completely lock the CPU.
  id: CWE-1281
CWE-1282:
  name: Assumed-Immutable Data is Stored in Writable Memory
  description: Security services such as secure boot, authentication of code and data,
    and device attestation all require assets such as the first stage bootloader,
    public keys, golden hash digests, etc. which are implicitly trusted. Storing these
    assets in read-only memory (ROM), fuses, or one-time programmable (OTP) memory
    provides strong integrity guarantees and provides a root of trust for securing
    the rest of the system. Security is lost if assets assumed to be immutable can
    be modified.
  id: CWE-1282
CWE-1283:
  name: Mutable Attestation or Measurement Reporting Data
  description: A System-on-Chip (SoC) implements secure boot or verified boot. During
    this boot flow, the SoC often measures the code that it authenticates. The measurement
    is usually done by calculating the one-way hash of the code binary and extending
    it to the previous hash. The hashing algorithm should be a Secure One-Way hash
    function. The final hash, i.e., the value obtained after the completion of the
    boot flow, serves as the measurement data used in reporting or in attestation.
    The calculated hash is often stored in registers that can later be read by the
    party of interest to determine tampering of the boot flow. A common weakness is
    that the contents in these registers are modifiable by an adversary, thus spoofing
    the measurement.
  id: CWE-1283
CWE-1284:
  name: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
  description: Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate,
    number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities
    to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the
    quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities
    to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer
    overflows, etc.
  id: CWE-1284
CWE-1285:
  name: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input
  description: Often, indexable resources such as memory buffers or files can be accessed
    using a specific position, index, or offset, such as an index for an array or
    a position for a file. When untrusted input is not properly validated before it
    is used as an index, attackers could access (or attempt to access) unauthorized
    portions of these resources. This could be used to cause buffer overflows, excessive
    resource allocation, or trigger unexpected failures.
  id: CWE-1285
CWE-1286:
  name: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
  description: Often, complex inputs are expected to follow a particular syntax, which
    is either assumed by the input itself, or declared within metadata such as headers.
    The syntax could be for data exchange formats, markup languages, or even programming
    languages. When untrusted input is not properly validated for the expected syntax,
    attackers could cause parsing failures, trigger unexpected errors, or expose latent
    vulnerabilities that might not be directly exploitable if the input had conformed
    to the syntax.
  id: CWE-1286
CWE-1287:
  name: Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input
  description: When input does not comply with the expected type, attackers could
    trigger unexpected errors, cause incorrect actions to take place, or exploit latent
    vulnerabilities that would not be possible if the input conformed with the expected
    type. This weakness can appear in type-unsafe programming languages, or in programming
    languages that support casting or conversion of an input to another type.
  id: CWE-1287
CWE-1288:
  name: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input
  description: Some input data can be structured with multiple elements or fields
    that must be consistent with each other, e.g. a number-of-items field that is
    followed by the expected number of elements. When such complex inputs are inconsistent,
    attackers could trigger unexpected errors, cause incorrect actions to take place,
    or exploit latent vulnerabilities.
  id: CWE-1288
CWE-1289:
  name: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
  description: Attackers can sometimes bypass input validation schemes by finding
    inputs that appear to be safe, but will be dangerous when processed at a lower
    layer or by a downstream component. For example, a simple XSS protection mechanism
    might try to validate that an input has no <script> tags using case-sensitive
    matching, but since HTML is case-insensitive when processed by web browsers, an
    attacker could inject <ScrIpT> and trigger XSS.
  id: CWE-1289
CWE-1290:
  name: 'Incorrect Decoding of Security Identifiers '
  description: In a System-On-Chip (SoC), various integrated circuits and hardware
    engines generate transactions such as to access (reads/writes) assets or perform
    certain actions (e.g., reset, fetch, compute, etc.). Among various types of message
    information, a typical transaction is comprised of source identity (to identify
    the originator of the transaction) and a destination identity (to route the transaction
    to the respective entity). Sometimes the transactions are qualified with a security
    identifier. The security identifier helps the destination agent decide on the
    set of allowed actions (e.g., access an asset for read and writes). A decoder
    decodes the bus transactions to map security identifiers into necessary access-controls/protections.
    A common weakness that can exist in this scenario is incorrect decoding because
    an untrusted agent's security identifier is decoded into a trusted agent's security
    identifier. Thus, an untrusted agent previously without access to an asset can
    now gain access to the asset.
  id: CWE-1290
CWE-1291:
  name: Public Key Re-Use for Signing both Debug and Production Code
  description: A common usage of public-key cryptography is to verify the integrity
    and authenticity of another entity (for example a firmware binary). If a company
    wants to ensure that its firmware runs only on its own hardware, before the firmware
    runs, an encrypted hash of the firmware image will be decrypted with the public
    key and then verified against the now-computed hash of the firmware image. This
    means that the public key forms the root of trust, which necessitates that the
    public key itself must be protected and used properly. During the development
    phase, debug firmware enables many hardware debug hooks, debug modes, and debug
    messages for testing. Those debug facilities provide significant, additional views
    about the firmware's capability and, in some cases, additional capability into
    the chip or SoC. If compromised, these capabilities could be exploited by an attacker
    to take full control of the system. Once the product exits the manufacturing stage
    and enters production, it is good practice to use a different public key. Debug
    firmware images are known to leak. With the debug key being reused as the production
    key, the debug image will also work on the production image. Thus, it will open
    all the internal, debug capabilities to the attacker. If a different public key
    is used for the production image, even if the attacker gains access to the debug
    firmware image, they will not be able to run it on a production machine. Thus,
    damage will be limited to the intellectual property leakage resulting from the
    debug image.
  id: CWE-1291
CWE-1292:
  name: Incorrect Conversion of Security Identifiers
  description: In a System-On-Chip (SoC), various integrated circuits and hardware
    engines generate transactions such as to access (reads/writes) assets or perform
    certain actions (e.g., reset, fetch, compute, etc.). Among various types of message
    information, a typical transaction is comprised of source identity (to identify
    the originator of the transaction) and a destination identity (to route the transaction
    to the respective entity). Sometimes the transactions are qualified with a security
    identifier. This security identifier helps the destination agent decide on the
    set of allowed actions (e.g., access an asset for read and writes). A typical
    bus connects several leader and follower agents. Some follower agents implement
    bus protocols differently from leader agents. A protocol conversion happens at
    a bridge to seamlessly connect different protocols on the bus. One example is
    a system that implements a leader with the Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB)
    protocol and a follower with the Open-Core Protocol (OCP). A bridge AHB-to-OCP
    is needed to translate the transaction from one form to the other. A common weakness
    that can exist in this scenario is that this conversion between protocols is implemented
    incorrectly, whereupon an untrusted agent may gain unauthorized access to an asset.
  id: CWE-1292
CWE-1293:
  name: Missing Source Correlation of Multiple Independent Data
  description: To operate successfully, a product sometimes has to implicitly trust
    the integrity of an information source. When information is implicitly signed,
    one can ensure that the data was not tampered in transit. This does not ensure
    that the information source was not compromised when responding to a request.
    By requesting information from multiple sources, one can check if all of the data
    is the same. If they are not, the system should report the information sources
    that respond with a different or minority value as potentially compromised. If
    there are not enough answers to provide a majority or plurality of responses,
    the system should report all of the sources as potentially compromised. As the
    seriousness of the impact of incorrect integrity increases, so should the number
    of independent information sources that would need to be queried.
  id: CWE-1293
CWE-1294:
  name: Insecure Security Identifier Mechanism
  description: Systems-On-Chip (Integrated circuits and hardware engines) implement
    Security Identifiers to differentiate/identify actions originated from various
    agents. These actions could be 'read', 'write', 'program', 'reset', 'fetch', 'compute',
    etc. Security identifiers are generated and assigned to every agent in the System
    (SoC) that is either capable of generating an action or receiving an action from
    another agent. Every agent could be assigned a unique, Security Identifier based
    on its trust level or privileges. A broad class of flaws can exist in the Security
    Identifier process, including but not limited to missing security identifiers,
    improper conversion of security identifiers, incorrect generation of security
    identifiers, etc.
  id: CWE-1294
CWE-1295:
  name: Debug Messages Revealing Unnecessary Information
  description: Debug messages are messages that help troubleshoot an issue by revealing
    the internal state of the system. For example, debug data in design can be exposed
    through internal memory array dumps or boot logs through interfaces like UART
    via TAP commands, scan chain, etc. Thus, the more information contained in a debug
    message, the easier it is to debug. However, there is also the risk of revealing
    information that could help an attacker either decipher a vulnerability, and/or
    gain a better understanding of the system. Thus, this extra information could
    lower the security by obscurity factor. While security by obscurity alone is insufficient,
    it can help as a part of Defense-in-depth.
  id: CWE-1295
CWE-1296:
  name: Incorrect Chaining or Granularity of Debug Components
  description: 'For debugging and troubleshooting a chip, several hardware design
    elements are often implemented, including: Various Test Access Ports (TAPs) allow
    boundary scan commands to be executed. For scanning the internal components of
    a chip, there are scan cells that allow the chip to be used as a stimulus and
    response mechanism. Chipmakers might create custom methods to observe the internal
    components of their chips by placing various tracing hubs within their chip and
    creating hierarchical or interconnected structures among those hubs. Logic errors
    during design or synthesis could misconfigure the interconnection of the debug
    components, which could allow unintended access permissions.'

CWE-1297:
  name: Unprotected Confidential Information on Device is Accessible by OSAT Vendors
  description: In contrast to complete vertical integration of architecting, designing,
    manufacturing, assembling, and testing chips all within a single organization,
    an organization can choose to simply architect and design a chip before outsourcing
    the rest of the process to OSAT entities (e.g., external foundries and test houses).
    In the latter example, the device enters an OSAT facility in a much more vulnerable
    pre-production stage where many debug and test modes are accessible. Therefore,
    the chipmaker must place a certain level of trust with the OSAT. To counter this,
    the chipmaker often requires the OSAT partner to enter into restrictive non-disclosure
    agreements (NDAs). Nonetheless, OSAT vendors likely have many customers, which
    increases the risk of accidental sharing of information. There may also be a security
    vulnerability in the information technology (IT) system of the OSAT facility.
    Alternatively, a malicious insider at the OSAT facility may carry out an insider
    attack. Considering these factors, it behooves the chipmaker to minimize any confidential
    information in the device that may be accessible to the OSAT vendor. Logic errors
    during design or synthesis could misconfigure the interconnection of the debug
    components, which could provide improper authorization to sensitive information.
  id: CWE-1297
CWE-1298:
  name: Hardware Logic Contains Race Conditions
  description: A race condition in logic circuits typically occurs when a logic gate
    gets inputs from signals that have traversed different paths while originating
    from the same source. Such inputs to the gate can change at slightly different
    times in response to a change in the source signal. This results in a timing error
    or a glitch (temporary or permanent) that causes the output to change to an unwanted
    state before settling back to the desired state. If such timing errors occur in
    access control logic or finite state machines that are implemented in security
    sensitive flows, an attacker might exploit them to circumvent existing protections.
  id: CWE-1298
CWE-1299:
  name: Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface
  description: An asset inside a chip might have access-control protections through
    one interface. However, if all paths to the asset are not protected, an attacker
    might compromise the asset through alternate paths. These alternate paths could
    be through shadow or mirror registers inside the IP core, or could be paths from
    other external-facing interfaces to the IP core or SoC. Consider an SoC with various
    interfaces such as UART, SMBUS, PCIe, USB, etc. If access control is implemented
    for SoC internal registers only over the PCIe interface, then an attacker could
    still modify the SoC internal registers through alternate paths by coming through
    interfaces such as UART, SMBUS, USB, etc. Alternatively, attackers might be able
    to bypass existing protections by exploiting unprotected, shadow registers. Shadow
    registers and mirror registers typically refer to registers that can be accessed
    from multiple addresses. Writing to or reading from the aliased/mirrored address
    has the same effect as writing to the address of the main register. They are typically
    implemented within an IP core or SoC to temporarily hold certain data. These data
    will later be updated to the main register, and both registers will be in synch.
    If the shadow registers are not access-protected, attackers could simply initiate
    transactions to the shadow registers and compromise system security.

CWE-1300:
  name: Improper Protection of Physical Side Channels
  description: An adversary could monitor and measure physical phenomena to detect
    patterns and make inferences, even if it is not possible to extract the information
    in the digital domain. Physical side channels have been well-studied for decades
    in the context of breaking implementations of cryptographic algorithms or other
    attacks against security features. These side channels may be easily observed
    by an adversary with physical access to the device, or using a tool that is in
    close proximity. If the adversary can monitor hardware operation and correlate
    its data processing with power, EME, and acoustic measurements, the adversary
    might be able to recover of secret keys and data.

CWE-1301:
  name: Insufficient or Incomplete Data Removal within Hardware Component
  description: Physical properties of hardware devices, such as remanence of magnetic
    media, residual charge of ROMs/RAMs, or screen burn-in may still retain sensitive
    data after a data removal process has taken place and power is removed. Recovering
    data after erasure or overwriting is possible due to a phenomenon called data
    remanence. For example, if the same value is written repeatedly to a memory location,
    the corresponding memory cells can become physically altered to a degree such
    that even after the original data is erased that data can still be recovered through
    physical characterization of the memory cells.
  id: CWE-1301
CWE-1302:
  name: Missing Source Identifier in Entity Transactions on a System-On-Chip (SOC)
  description: In a System-On-Chip (SoC), various integrated circuits and hardware
    engines generate transactions such as to access (reads/writes) assets or perform
    certain actions (e.g., reset, fetch, compute). A typical transaction is comprised
    of source identity (to identify the originator of the transaction) and a destination
    identity (to route the transaction to the respective entity) in addition to much
    more information in the message. Sometimes the transactions are qualified with
    a Security Identifier. This Security Identifier helps the destination agent decide
    on the set of allowed or disallowed actions. A weakness that can exist in such
    transaction schemes is that the source agent does not consistently include the
    necessary Security Identifier with the transaction. If the Security Identifier
    is missing, the destination agent might drop the message (resulting in an inadvertent
    Denial-of-Service (DoS)) or take inappropriate action by default in its attempt
    to execute the transaction, resulting in privilege escalation or provision of
    unintended access.
  id: CWE-1302
CWE-1303:
  name: Non-Transparent Sharing of Microarchitectural Resources
  description: Modern processors use techniques such as out-of-order execution, speculation,
    prefetching, data forwarding, and caching to increase performance. Details about
    the implementation of these techniques are hidden from the programmer's view.
    This is problematic when the hardware implementation of these techniques results
    in resources being shared across supposedly isolated contexts. Contention for
    shared resources between different contexts opens covert channels that allow malicious
    programs executing in one context to recover information from another context.
    Some examples of shared micro-architectural resources that have been used to leak
    information between contexts are caches, branch prediction logic, and load or
    store buffers. Speculative and out-of-order execution provides an attacker with
    increased control over which data is leaked through the covert channel. If the
    extent of resource sharing between contexts in the design microarchitecture is
    undocumented, it is extremely difficult to ensure system assets are protected
    against disclosure.

CWE-1304:
  name: Improperly Preserved Integrity of Hardware Configuration State During a Power
    Save/Restore Operation
  description: Before powering down, the Intellectual Property (IP) saves current
    state (S) to persistent storage such as flash or always-on memory in order to
    optimize the restore operation. During this process, an attacker with access to
    the persistent storage may alter (S) to a configuration that could potentially
    modify privileges, disable protections, and/or cause damage to the hardware. If
    the IP does not validate the configuration state stored in persistent memory,
    upon regaining power or becoming operational again, the IP could be compromised
    through the activation of an unwanted/harmful configuration.

CWE-1310:
  name: Missing Ability to Patch ROM Code
  description: A System or System-on-Chip (SoC) that implements a boot process utilizing
    security mechanisms such as Root-of-Trust (RoT) typically starts by executing
    code from a Read-only-Memory (ROM) component. The code in ROM is immutable, hence
    any security vulnerabilities discovered in the ROM code can never be fixed for
    the systems that are already in use. A common weakness is that the ROM does not
    have the ability to patch if security vulnerabilities are uncovered after the
    system gets shipped. This leaves the system in a vulnerable state where an adversary
    can compromise the SoC.
  id: CWE-1310
CWE-1311:
  name: Improper Translation of Security Attributes by Fabric Bridge
  description: A bridge allows IP blocks supporting different fabric protocols to
    be integrated into the system. Fabric end-points or interfaces usually have dedicated
    signals to transport security attributes. For example, HPROT signals in AHB, AxPROT
    signals in AXI, and MReqInfo and SRespInfo signals in OCP. The values on these
    signals are used to indicate the security attributes of the transaction. These
    include the immutable hardware identity of the controller initiating the transaction,
    privilege level, and type of transaction (e.g., read/write, cacheable/non-cacheable,
    posted/non-posted). A weakness can arise if the bridge IP block, which translates
    the signals from the protocol used in the IP block endpoint to the protocol used
    by the central bus, does not properly translate the security attributes. As a
    result, the identity of the initiator could be translated from untrusted to trusted
    or vice-versa. This could result in access-control bypass, privilege escalation,
    or denial of service.

CWE-1312:
  name: Missing Protection for Mirrored Regions in On-Chip Fabric Firewall
  description: Few fabrics mirror memory and address ranges, where mirrored regions
    contain copies of the original data. This redundancy is used to achieve fault
    tolerance. Whatever protections the fabric firewall implements for the original
    region should also apply to the mirrored regions. If not, an attacker could bypass
    existing read/write protections by reading from/writing to the mirrored regions
    to leak or corrupt the original data.

CWE-1313:
  name: Hardware Allows Activation of Test or Debug Logic at Runtime
  description: An adversary can take advantage of test or debug logic that is made
    accessible through the hardware during normal operation to modify the intended
    behavior of the system. For example, an accessible Test/debug mode may allow read/write
    access to any system data. Using error injection (a common test/debug feature)
    during a transmit/receive operation on a bus, data may be modified to produce
    an unintended message. Similarly, confidentiality could be compromised by such
    features allowing access to secrets.
  id: CWE-1313
CWE-1314:
  name: Missing Write Protection for Parametric Data Values
  description: Various sensors are used by hardware to detect any devices operating
    outside of the design limits. The threshold limit values are set by hardware fuses
    or trusted software such as the BIOS. These limits may be related to thermal,
    power, voltage, current, and frequency. Hardware mechanisms may be used to protect
    against alteration of the threshold limit values by untrusted software. The limit
    values are generally programmed in standard units for the type of value being
    read. However, the hardware-sensor blocks may report the settings in different
    units depending upon sensor design and operation. The raw sensor output value
    is converted to the desired units using a scale conversion based on the parametric
    data programmed into the sensor. The final converted value is then compared with
    the previously programmed limits. While the limit values are usually protected,
    the sensor parametric data values may not be. By changing the parametric data,
    safe operational limits may be bypassed.
  id: CWE-1314
CWE-1315:
  name: Improper Setting of Bus Controlling Capability in Fabric End-point
  description: To support reusability, certain fabric interfaces and end points provide
    a configurable register bit that allows IP blocks connected to the controller
    to access other peripherals connected to the fabric. This allows the end point
    to be used with devices that function as a controller or responder. If this bit
    is set by default in hardware, or if firmware incorrectly sets it later, a device
    intended to be a responder on a fabric is now capable of controlling transactions
    to other devices and might compromise system security.

    and Unprotected Ranges
  description: Various ranges can be defined in the system-address map, either in
    the memory or in Memory-Mapped-IO (MMIO) space. These ranges are usually defined
    using special range registers that contain information, such as base address and
    size. Address decoding is the process of determining for which range the incoming
    transaction is destined. To ensure isolation, ranges containing secret data are
    access-control protected. Occasionally, these ranges could overlap. The overlap
    could either be intentional (e.g. due to a limited number of range registers or
    limited choice in choosing size of the range) or unintentional (e.g. introduced
    by errors). Some hardware designs allow dynamic remapping of address ranges assigned
    to peripheral MMIO ranges. In such designs, intentional address overlaps can be
    created through misconfiguration by malicious software. When protected and unprotected
    ranges overlap, an attacker could send a transaction and potentially compromise
    the protections in place, violating the principle of least privilege.

CWE-1317:
  name: Improper Access Control in Fabric Bridge
  description: In hardware designs, different IP blocks are connected through interconnect-bus
    fabrics (e.g. AHB and OCP). Within a System on Chip (SoC), the IP block subsystems
    could be using different bus protocols. In such a case, the IP blocks are then
    linked to the central bus (and to other IP blocks) through a fabric bridge. Bridges
    are used as bus-interconnect-routing modules that link different protocols or
    separate, different segments of the overall SoC interconnect. For overall system
    security, it is important that the access-control privileges associated with any
    fabric transaction are consistently maintained and applied, even when they are
    routed or translated by a fabric bridge. A bridge that is connected to a fabric
    without security features forwards transactions to the slave without checking
    the privilege level of the master and results in a weakness in SoC access-control
    security. The same weakness occurs if a bridge does not check the hardware identity
    of the transaction received from the slave interface of the bridge.
  id: CWE-1317
CWE-1318:
  name: Missing Support for Security Features in On-chip Fabrics or Buses
  description: Certain on-chip fabrics and buses, especially simple and low-power
    buses, do not support security features. Apart from data transfer and addressing
    ports, some fabrics and buses do not have any interfaces to transfer privilege,
    immutable identity, or any other security attribute coming from the bus master.
    Similarly, they do not have dedicated signals to transport security-sensitive
    data from slave to master, such as completions for certain types of transactions.
    Few other on-chip fabrics and buses support security features and define specific
    interfaces/signals for transporting security attributes from master to slave or
    vice-versa. However, including these signals is not mandatory and could be left
    unconfigured when generating the register-transfer-level (RTL) description for
    the fabric. Such fabrics or buses should not be used to transport any security
    attribute coming from the bus master. In general, peripherals with security assets
    should not be connected to such buses before the transaction from the bus master
    reaches the bus, unless some form of access control is performed at a fabric bridge
    or another intermediate module.

  name: Improper Protection against Electromagnetic Fault Injection (EM-FI)
  description: 'Electromagnetic fault injection may allow an attacker to locally and
    dynamically modify the signals (both internal and external) of an integrated circuit.
    EM-FI attacks consist of producing a local, transient magnetic field near the
    device, inducing current in the device wires. A typical EMFI setup is made up
    of a pulse injection circuit that generates a high current transient in an EMI
    coil, producing an abrupt magnetic pulse which couples to the target producing
    faults in the device, which can lead to: Bypassing security mechanisms such as
    secure JTAG or Secure Boot Leaking device information Modifying program flow Perturbing
    secure hardware modules (e.g. random number generators)'

CWE-1320:
  name: Improper Protection for Outbound Error Messages and Alert Signals
  description: Hardware sensors are used to detect whether a device is operating within
    design limits. The threshold values for these limits are set by hardware fuses
    or trusted software such as a BIOS. Modification of these limits may be protected
    by hardware mechanisms. When device sensors detect out of bound conditions, alert
    signals may be generated for remedial action, which may take the form of device
    shutdown or throttling. Warning signals that are not properly secured may be disabled
    or used to generate spurious alerts, causing degraded performance or denial-of-service
    (DoS). These alerts may be masked by untrusted software. Examples of these alerts
    involve thermal and power sensor alerts.

CWE-1321:
  name: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype
    Pollution')
  description: By adding or modifying attributes of an object prototype, it is possible
    to create attributes that exist on every object, or replace critical attributes
    with malicious ones. This can be problematic if the product depends on existence
    or non-existence of certain attributes, or uses pre-defined attributes of object
    prototype (such as hasOwnProperty, toString or valueOf). This weakness is usually
    exploited by using a special attribute of objects called proto, constructor or
    prototype. Such attributes give access to the object prototype. This weakness
    is often found in code that assigns object attributes based on user input, or
    merges or clones objects recursively.

CWE-1322:
  name: Use of Blocking Code in Single-threaded, Non-blocking Context
  description: When an attacker can directly invoke the blocking code, or the blocking
    code can be affected by environmental conditions that can be influenced by an
    attacker, then this can lead to a denial of service by causing unexpected hang
    or freeze of the code. Examples of blocking code might be an expensive computation
    or calling blocking library calls, such as those that perform exclusive file operations
    or require a successful network operation. Due to limitations in multi-thread
    models, single-threaded models are used to overcome the resource constraints that
    are caused by using many threads. In such a model, all code should generally be
    non-blocking. If blocking code is called, then the event loop will effectively
    be stopped, which can be undesirable or dangerous. Such models are used in Python
    asyncio, Vert.x, and Node.js, or other custom event loop code.
  id: CWE-1322
CWE-1323:
  name: Improper Management of Sensitive Trace Data
  description: To facilitate verification of complex System-on-Chip (SoC) designs,
    SoC integrators add specific IP blocks that trace the SoC's internal signals in
    real-time. This infrastructure enables observability of the SoC's internal behavior,
    validation of its functional design, and detection of hardware and software bugs.
    Such tracing IP blocks collect traces from several sources on the SoC including
    the CPU, crypto coprocessors, and on-chip fabrics. Traces collected from these
    sources are then aggregated inside trace IP block and forwarded to trace sinks,
    such as debug-trace ports that facilitate debugging by external hardware and software
    debuggers. Since these traces are collected from several security-sensitive sources,
    they must be protected against untrusted debuggers. If they are stored in unprotected
    memory, an untrusted software debugger can access these traces and extract secret
    information. Additionally, if security-sensitive traces are not tagged as secure,
    an untrusted hardware debugger might access them to extract confidential information.

  name: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation
  description: While the product might limit the amount of memory that is allocated
    in a single operation for a single object (such as a malloc of an array), if an
    attacker can cause multiple objects to be allocated in separate operations, then
    this might cause higher total memory consumption than the developer intended,
    leading to a denial of service.
  id: CWE-1325
CWE-1326:
  name: Missing Immutable Root of Trust in Hardware
  description: A System-on-Chip (SoC) implements secure boot by verifying or authenticating
    signed boot code. The signing of the code is achieved by an entity that the SoC
    trusts. Before executing the boot code, the SoC verifies that the code or the
    public key with which the code has been signed has not been tampered with. The
    other data upon which the SoC depends are system-hardware settings in fuses such
    as whether Secure Boot is enabled. These data play a crucial role in establishing
    a Root of Trust (RoT) to execute secure-boot flows. One of the many ways RoT is
    achieved is by storing the code and data in memory or fuses. This memory should
    be immutable, i.e., once the RoT is programmed/provisioned in memory, that memory
    should be locked and prevented from further programming or writes. If the memory
    contents (i.e., RoT) are mutable, then an adversary can modify the RoT to execute
    their choice of code, resulting in a compromised secure boot. Note that, for components
    like ROM, secure patching/update features should be supported to allow authenticated
    and authorized updates in the field.

CWE-1327:
  name: Binding to an Unrestricted IP Address
  description: When a server binds to the address 0.0.0.0, it allows connections from
    every IP address on the local machine, effectively exposing the server to every
    possible network. This might be much broader access than intended by the developer
    or administrator, who might only be expecting the server to be reachable from
    a single interface/network.
  id: CWE-1327
CWE-1328:
  name: Security Version Number Mutable to Older Versions
  description: A System-on-Chip (SoC) implements secure boot or verified boot. It
    might support a security version number, which prevents downgrading the current
    firmware to a vulnerable version. Once downgraded to a previous version, an adversary
    can launch exploits on the SoC and thus compromise the security of the SoC. These
    downgrade attacks are also referred to as roll-back attacks. The security version
    number must be stored securely and persistently across power-on resets. A common
    weakness is that the security version number is modifiable by an adversary, allowing
    roll-back or downgrade attacks or, under certain circumstances, preventing upgrades
    (i.e. Denial-of-Service on upgrades). In both cases, the SoC is in a vulnerable
    state.
  id: CWE-1328
CWE-1329:
  name: Reliance on Component That is Not Updateable
  description: If the component is discovered to contain a vulnerability or critical
    bug, but the issue cannot be fixed using an update or patch, then the product's
    owner will not be able to protect against the issue. The only option might be
    replacement of the product, which could be too financially or operationally expensive
    for the product owner. As a result, the inability to patch or update can leave
    the product open to attacker exploitation or critical operation failures. This
    weakness can be especially difficult to manage when using ROM, firmware, or similar
    components that traditionally have had limited or no update capabilities. In industries
    such as healthcare, legacy devices can be operated for decades. As a US task force
    report [REF-1197] notes, the inability to update or replace equipment has both
    large and small health care delivery organizations struggle with numerous unsupported
    legacy systems that cannot easily be replaced (hardware, software, and operating
    systems) with large numbers of vulnerabilities and few modern countermeasures.
    While hardware can be prone to this weakness, software systems can also be affected,
    such as when a third-party driver or library is no longer actively maintained
    or supported but is still critical for the required functionality.
  id: CWE-1329
CWE-1330:
  name: Remanent Data Readable after Memory Erase
  description: Data remanence occurs when stored, memory content is not fully lost
    after a memory-clear or -erase operation. Confidential memory contents can still
    be readable through data remanence in the hardware. Data remanence can occur because
    of performance optimization or memory organization during 'clear' or 'erase' operations,
    like a design that allows the memory-organization metadata (e.g., file pointers)
    to be erased without erasing the actual memory content. To protect against this
    weakness, memory devices will often support different commands for optimized memory
    erase and explicit secure erase. Data remanence can also happen because of the
    physical properties of memory circuits in use. For example, static, random-access-memory
    (SRAM) and dynamic, random-access-memory (DRAM) data retention is based on the
    charge retained in the memory cell, which depends on factors such as power supply,
    refresh rates, and temperature. Other than explicit erase commands, self-encrypting,
    secure-memory devices can also support secure erase through cryptographic erase
    commands. In such designs, only the decryption keys for encrypted data stored
    on the device are erased. That is, the stored data are always remnant in the media
    after a cryptographic erase. However, only the encrypted data can be extracted.
    Thus, protection against data recovery in such designs relies on the strength
    of the encryption algorithm.

CWE-1331:
  name: Improper Isolation of Shared Resources in Network On Chip (NoC)
  description: Typically, network on chips (NoC) have many internal resources that
    are shared between packets from different trust domains. These resources include
    internal buffers, crossbars and switches, individual ports, and channels. The
    sharing of resources causes contention and introduces interference between differently
    trusted domains, which poses a security threat via a timing channel, allowing
    attackers to infer data that belongs to a trusted agent. This may also result
    in introducing network interference, resulting in degraded throughput and latency.
  id: CWE-1331
CWE-1332:
  name: Improper Handling of Faults that Lead to Instruction Skips
  description: The operating conditions of hardware may change in ways that cause
    unexpected behavior to occur, including the skipping of security-critical CPU
    instructions. Generally, this can occur due to electrical disturbances or when
    the device operates outside of its expected conditions. In practice, application
    code may contain conditional branches that are security-sensitive (e.g., accepting
    or rejecting a user-provided password). These conditional branches are typically
    implemented by a single conditional branch instruction in the program binary which,
    if skipped, may lead to effectively flipping the branch condition - i.e., causing
    the wrong security-sensitive branch to be taken. This affects processes such as
    firmware authentication, password verification, and other security-sensitive decision
    points. Attackers can use fault injection techniques to alter the operating conditions
    of hardware so that security-critical instructions are skipped more frequently
    or more reliably than they would in a natural setting.
  id: CWE-1332
CWE-1333:
  name: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
  description: 'Some regular expression engines have a feature called backtracking.
    If the token cannot match, the engine backtracks to a position that may result
    in a different token that can match. Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of
    these conditions are met: The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential
    relative to the length of the input. The input can fail to match the regular expression.
    The input can be long enough. Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally
    cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes
    the CPU consumption to spike.'

CWE-1334:
  name: Unauthorized Error Injection Can Degrade Hardware Redundancy
  description: To ensure the performance and functional reliability of certain components,
    hardware designers can implement hardware blocks for redundancy in the case that
    others fail. This redundant block can be prevented from performing as intended
    if the design allows unauthorized agents to inject errors into it. In this way,
    a path with injected errors may become unavailable to serve as a redundant channel.
    This may put the system into a degraded mode of operation which could be exploited
    by a subsequent attack.

CWE-1335:
  name: Incorrect Bitwise Shift of Integer
  description: Specifying a value to be shifted by a negative amount is undefined
    in various languages. Various computer architectures implement this action in
    different ways. The compilers and interpreters when generating code to accomplish
    a shift generally do not do a check for this issue. Specifying an over-shift,
    a shift greater than or equal to the number of bits contained in a value to be
    shifted, produces a result which varies by architecture and compiler. In some
    languages, this action is specifically listed as producing an undefined result.

CWE-1336:
  name: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine
  description: Many web applications use template engines that allow developers to
    insert externally-influenced values into free text or messages in order to generate
    a full web page, document, message, etc. Such engines include Twig, Jinja2, Pug,
    Java Server Pages, FreeMarker, Velocity, ColdFusion, Smarty, and many others -
    including PHP itself. Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.
    Template engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If
    an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the
    attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For
    example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression {{7*7}}
    and determine if the output returns 49 instead. The syntax varies depending on
    the language. In some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the
    root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the
    error. Template engines can be used on the server or client, so both sides could
    be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies
    might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.

CWE-1338:
  name: Improper Protections Against Hardware Overheating
  description: Hardware, electrical circuits, and semiconductor silicon have thermal
    side effects, such that some of the energy consumed by the device gets dissipated
    as heat and increases the temperature of the device. For example, in semiconductors,
    higher-operating frequency of silicon results in higher power dissipation and
    heat. The leakage current in CMOS circuits increases with temperature, and this
    creates positive feedback that can result in thermal runaway and damage the device
    permanently. Any device lacking protections such as thermal sensors, adequate
    platform cooling, or thermal insulation is susceptible to attacks by malicious
    software that might deliberately operate the device in modes that result in overheating.
    This can be used as an effective denial of service (DoS) or permanent denial of
    service (PDoS) attack. Depending on the type of hardware device and its expected
    usage, such thermal overheating can also cause safety hazards and reliability
    issues. Note that battery failures can also cause device overheating but the mitigations
    and examples included in this submission cannot reliably protect against a battery
    failure. There can be similar weaknesses with lack of protection from attacks
    based on overvoltage or overcurrent conditions. However, thermal heat is generated
    by hardware operation and the device should implement protection from overheating.
  id: CWE-1338
CWE-1339:
  name: Insufficient Precision or Accuracy of a Real Number
  description: When a security decision or calculation requires highly precise, accurate
    numbers such as financial calculations or prices, then small variations in the
    number could be exploited by an attacker. There are multiple ways to store the
    fractional part of a real number in a computer. In all of these cases, there is
    a limit to the accuracy of recording a fraction. If the fraction can be represented
    in a fixed number of digits (binary or decimal), there might not be enough digits
    assigned to represent the number. In other cases the number cannot be represented
    in a fixed number of digits due to repeating in decimal or binary notation (e.g.
    0.333333...) or due to a transcendental number such as Π or √2. Rounding of numbers
    can lead to situations where the computer results do not adequately match the
    result of sufficiently accurate math.
  id: CWE-1339
CWE-1341:
  name: Multiple Releases of Same Resource or Handle
  description: Code typically requires opening handles or references to resources
    such as memory, files, devices, socket connections, services, etc. When the code
    is finished with using the resource, it is typically expected to close or release
    the resource, which indicates to the environment (such as the OS) that the resource
    can be re-assigned or reused by unrelated processes or actors - or in some cases,
    within the same process. API functions or other abstractions are often used to
    perform this release, such as free() or delete() within C/C++, or file-handle
    close() operations that are used in many languages. Unfortunately, the implementation
    or design of such APIs might expect the developer to be responsible for ensuring
    that such APIs are only called once per release of the resource. If the developer
    attempts to release the same resource/handle more than once, then the API's expectations
    are not met, resulting in undefined and/or insecure behavior. This could lead
    to consequences such as memory corruption, data corruption, execution path corruption,
    or other consequences. Note that while the implementation for most (if not all)
    resource reservation allocations involve a unique identifier/pointer/symbolic
    reference, then if this identifier is reused, checking the identifier for resource
    closure may result in a false state of openness and closing of the wrong resource.
    For this reason, reuse of identifiers is discouraged.
  id: CWE-1341
CWE-1342:
  name: Information Exposure through Microarchitectural State after Transient Execution
  description: 'In many processor architectures an exception, mis-speculation, or
    microcode assist results in a flush operation to clear results that are no longer
    required. This action prevents these results from influencing architectural state
    that is intended to be visible from software. However, traces of this transient
    execution may remain in microarchitectural buffers, resulting in a change in microarchitectural
    state that can expose sensitive information to an attacker using side-channel
    analysis. For example, Load Value Injection (LVI) [REF-1202] can exploit direct
    injection of erroneous values into intermediate load and store buffers. Several
    conditions may need to be fulfilled for a successful attack: incorrect transient
    execution that results in remanence of sensitive information; attacker has the
    ability to provoke microarchitectural exceptions; operations and structures in
    victim code that can be exploited must be identified.'
  id: CWE-1342
CWE-1351:
  name: Improper Handling of Hardware Behavior in Exceptionally Cold Environments
  description: The hardware designer may improperly anticipate hardware behavior when
    exposed to exceptionally cold conditions. As a result they may introduce a weakness
    by not accounting for the modified behavior of critical components when in extreme
    environments. An example of a change in behavior is that power loss won't clear/reset
    any volatile state when cooled below standard operating temperatures. This may
    result in a weakness when the starting state of the volatile memory is being relied
    upon for a security decision. For example, a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF)
    may be supplied as a security primitive to improve confidentiality, authenticity,
    and integrity guarantees. However, when the PUF is paired with DRAM, SRAM, or
    another temperature sensitive entropy source, the system designer may introduce
    weakness by failing to account for the chosen entropy source's behavior at exceptionally
    low temperatures. In the case of DRAM and SRAM, when power is cycled at low temperatures,
    the device will not contain the bitwise biasing caused by inconsistencies in manufacturing
    and will instead contain the data from previous boot. Should the PUF primitive
    be used in a cryptographic construction which does not account for full adversary
    control of PUF seed data, weakness would arise. This weakness does not cover Cold
    Boot Attacks wherein RAM or other external storage is super cooled and read externally
    by an attacker.

CWE-1357:
  name: Reliance on Insufficiently Trustworthy Component
  description: Many modern hardware and software products are built by combining multiple
    smaller components together into one larger entity, often during the design or
    architecture phase. For example, a hardware component might be built by a separate
    supplier, or the product might use an open-source software library from a third
    party. Regardless of the source, each component should be sufficiently trusted
    to ensure correct, secure operation of the product. If a component is not trustworthy,
    it can produce significant risks for the overall product, such as vulnerabilities
    that cannot be patched fast enough (if at all); hidden functionality such as malware;
    inability to update or replace the component if needed for security purposes;
    hardware components built from parts that do not meet specifications in ways that
    can lead to weaknesses; etc. Note that a component might not be trustworthy even
    if it is owned by the product vendor, such as a software component whose source
    code is lost and was built by developers who left the company, or a component
    that was developed by a separate company that was acquired and brought into the
    product's own company. Note that there can be disagreement as to whether a component
    is sufficiently trustworthy, since trust is ultimately subjective. Different stakeholders
    (e.g., customers, vendors, governments) have various threat models and ways to
    assess trust, and design/architecture choices might make tradeoffs between security,
    reliability, safety, privacy, cost, and other characteristics.

  name: Improper Handling of Physical or Environmental Conditions
  description: 'Hardware products are typically only guaranteed to behave correctly
    within certain physical limits or environmental conditions. Such products cannot
    necessarily control the physical or external conditions to which they are subjected.
    However, the inability to handle such conditions can undermine a product''s security.
    For example, an unexpected physical or environmental condition may cause the flipping
    of a bit that is used for an authentication decision. This unexpected condition
    could occur naturally or be induced artificially by an adversary. Physical or
    environmental conditions of concern are: Atmospheric characteristics: extreme
    temperature ranges, etc. Interference: electromagnetic interference (EMI), radio
    frequency interference (RFI), etc. Assorted light sources: white light, ultra-violet

  name: Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets
  description: WebSockets provide a bi-directional low latency communication (near
    real-time) between a client and a server. WebSockets are different than HTTP in
    that the connections are long-lived, as the channel will remain open until the
    client or the server is ready to send the message, whereas in HTTP, once the response
    occurs (which typically happens immediately), the transaction completes. A WebSocket
    can leverage the existing HTTP protocol over ports 80 and 443, but it is not limited
    to HTTP. WebSockets can make cross-origin requests that are not restricted by
    browser-based protection mechanisms such as the Same Origin Policy (SOP) or Cross-Origin
    Resource Sharing (CORS). Without explicit origin validation, this makes CSRF attacks
    more powerful.

CWE-1386:
  name: Insecure Operation on Windows Junction / Mount Point
  description: Depending on the intended action being performed, this could allow
    an attacker to cause the product to read, write, delete, or otherwise operate
    on unauthorized files. In Windows, NTFS5 allows for file system objects called
    reparse points. Applications can create a hard link from one directory to another
    directory, called a junction point. They can also create a mapping from a directory
    to a drive letter, called a mount point. If a file is used by a privileged program,
    but it can be replaced with a hard link to a sensitive file (e.g., AUTOEXEC.BAT),
    an attacker could excalate privileges. When the process opens the file, the attacker
    can assume the privileges of that process, tricking the privileged process to
    read, modify, or delete the sensitive file, preventing the program from accurately
    processing data. Note that one can also point to registries and semaphores.
  id: CWE-1386
CWE-1389:
  name: Incorrect Parsing of Numbers with Different Radices
  description: Frequently, a numeric input that begins with 0 is treated as octal,
    or 0x causes it to be treated as hexadecimal, e.g. by the inet_addr() function.
    For example, 023 (octal) is 35 decimal, or 0x31 is 49 decimal. Other bases may
    be used as well. If the developer assumes decimal-only inputs, the code could
    produce incorrect numbers when the inputs are parsed using a different base. This
    can result in unexpected and/or dangerous behavior. For example, a 0127.0.0.1
    IP address is parsed as octal due to the leading 0, whose numeric value would
    be the same as 87.0.0.1 (decimal), where the developer likely expected to use
    127.0.0.1. The consequences vary depending on the surrounding code in which this
    weakness occurs, but they can include bypassing network-based access control using
    unexpected IP addresses or netmasks, or causing apparently-symbolic identifiers
    to be processed as if they are numbers. In web applications, this can enable bypassing
    of SSRF restrictions.

CWE-1391:
  name: Use of Weak Credentials
  description: 'By design, authentication protocols try to ensure that attackers must
    perform brute force attacks if they do not know the credentials such as a key
    or password. However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed
    (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat
    the mechanism without relying on brute force. Credentials may be weak for different
    reasons, such as: Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)
    Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations,
    but able to be changed by the administrator) Predictable (i.e., generated in a
    way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can
    still be guessed with reasonable efficiency) Even if a new, unique credential
    is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is
    predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.'

  description: It is common practice for products to be designed to use default keys,
    passwords, or other mechanisms for authentication. The rationale is to simplify
    the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and
    deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults,
    it is easier for attackers to bypass authentication quickly across multiple organizations.

    However, if admins do not change the defaults, then it makes it easier for attackers

  name: Dependency on Vulnerable Third-Party Component
  description: Many products are large enough or complex enough that part of their
    functionality uses libraries, modules, or other intellectual property developed
    by third parties who are not the product creator. For example, even an entire
    operating system might be from a third-party supplier in some hardware products.
    Whether open or closed source, these components may contain publicly known vulnerabilities
    that could be exploited by adversaries to compromise the product.
  id: CWE-1395
CWE-1419:
  name: Incorrect Initialization of Resource
  description: This can have security implications when the associated resource is
    expected to have certain properties or values. Examples include a variable that
    determines whether a user has been authenticated or not, or a register or fuse
    value that determines the security state of the product. For software, this weakness
    can frequently occur when implicit initialization is used, meaning the resource
    is not explicitly set to a specific value. For example, in C, memory is not necessarily
    cleared when it is allocated on the stack, and many scripting languages use a
    default empty, null value, or zero value when a variable is not explicitly initialized.
    For hardware, this weakness frequently appears with reset values and fuses. After
    a product reset, hardware may initialize registers incorrectly. During different
    phases of a product lifecycle, fuses may be set to incorrect values. Even if fuses
    are set to correct values, the lines to the fuse could be broken or there might
    be hardware on the fuse line that alters the fuse value to be incorrect.

CWE-1420:
  name: Exposure of Sensitive Information during Transient Execution
  description: When operations execute but do not commit to the processor's architectural
    state, this is commonly referred to as transient execution. This behavior can
    occur when the processor mis-predicts an outcome (such as a branch target), or
    when a processor event (such as an exception or microcode assist, etc.) is handled
    after younger operations have already executed. Operations that execute transiently
    may exhibit observable discrepancies (CWE-203) in covert channels [REF-1400] such
    as data caches. Observable discrepancies of this kind can be detected and analyzed
    using timing or power analysis techniques, which may allow an attacker to infer
    information about the operations that executed transiently. For example, the attacker
    may be able to infer confidential data that was accessed or used by those operations.
    Transient execution weaknesses may be exploited using one of two methods. In the
    first method, the attacker generates a code sequence that exposes data through
    a covert channel when it is executed transiently (the attacker must also be able
    to trigger transient execution). Some transient execution weaknesses can only
    expose data that is accessible within the attacker's processor context. For example,
    an attacker executing code in a software sandbox may be able to use a transient
    execution weakness to expose data within the same address space, but outside of
    the attacker's sandbox. Other transient execution weaknesses can expose data that
    is architecturally inaccessible, that is, data protected by hardware-enforced
    boundaries such as page tables or privilege rings. These weaknesses are the subject
    of CWE-1421. In the second exploitation method, the attacker first identifies
    a code sequence in a victim program that, when executed transiently, can expose
    data that is architecturally accessible within the victim's processor context.
    For instance, the attacker may search the victim program for code sequences that
    resemble a bounds-check bypass sequence (see Demonstrative Example 1). If the
    attacker can trigger a mis-prediction of the conditional branch and influence
    the index of the out-of-bounds array access, then the attacker may be able to
    infer the value of out-of-bounds data by monitoring observable discrepancies in
    a covert channel.

CWE-1421:
  name: Exposure of Sensitive Information in Shared Microarchitectural Structures
    during Transient Execution
  description: Many commodity processors have Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) features
    that protect software components from one another. These features can include
    memory segmentation, virtual memory, privilege rings, trusted execution environments,
    and virtual machines, among others. For example, virtual memory provides each
    process with its own address space, which prevents processes from accessing each
    other's private data. Many of these features can be used to form hardware-enforced
    security boundaries between software components. Many commodity processors also
    share microarchitectural resources that cache (temporarily store) data, which
    may be confidential. These resources may be shared across processor contexts,
    including across SMT threads, privilege rings, or others. When transient operations
    allow access to ISA-protected data in a shared microarchitectural resource, this
    might violate users' expectations of the ISA feature that is bypassed. For example,
    if transient operations can access a victim's private data in a shared microarchitectural
    resource, then the operations' microarchitectural side effects may correspond
    to the accessed data. If an attacker can trigger these transient operations and
    observe their side effects through a covert channel [REF-1400], then the attacker
    may be able to infer the victim's private data. Private data could include sensitive
    program data, OS/VMM data, page table data (such as memory addresses), system
    configuration data (see Demonstrative Example 3), or any other data that the attacker
    does not have the required privileges to access.
  id: CWE-1421
CWE-1422:
  name: Exposure of Sensitive Information caused by Incorrect Data Forwarding during
    Transient Execution
  description: Software may use a variety of techniques to preserve the confidentiality
    of private data that is accessible within the current processor context. For example,
    the memory safety and type safety properties of some high-level programming languages
    help to prevent software written in those languages from exposing private data.
    As a second example, software sandboxes may co-locate multiple users' software
    within a single process. The processor's Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) may
    permit one user's software to access another user's data (because the software
    shares the same address space), but the sandbox prevents these accesses by using
    software techniques such as bounds checking. If incorrect or stale data can be
    forwarded (for example, from a cache) to transient operations, then the operations'
    microarchitectural side effects may correspond to the data. If an attacker can
    trigger these transient operations and observe their side effects through a covert
    channel, then the attacker may be able to infer the data. For example, an attacker
    process may induce transient execution in a victim process that causes the victim
    to inadvertently access and then expose its private data via a covert channel.
    In the software sandbox example, an attacker sandbox may induce transient execution
    in its own code, allowing it to transiently access and expose data in a victim
    sandbox that shares the same address space. Consequently, weaknesses that arise
    from incorrect/stale data forwarding might violate users' expectations of software-based
    memory safety and isolation techniques. If the data forwarding behavior is not
    properly documented by the hardware vendor, this might violate the software vendor's
    expectation of how the hardware should behave.

CWE-1423:
  name: Exposure of Sensitive Information caused by Shared Microarchitectural Predictor
    State that Influences Transient Execution
  description: Many commodity processors have Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) features
    that protect software components from one another. These features can include
    memory segmentation, virtual memory, privilege rings, trusted execution environments,
    and virtual machines, among others. For example, virtual memory provides each
    process with its own address space, which prevents processes from accessing each
    other's private data. Many of these features can be used to form hardware-enforced
    security boundaries between software components. When separate software components
    (for example, two processes) share microarchitectural predictor state across a
    hardware boundary, code in one component may be able to influence microarchitectural
    predictor behavior in another component. If the predictor can cause transient
    execution, the shared predictor state may allow an attacker to influence transient
    execution in a victim, and in a manner that could allow the attacker to infer
    private data from the victim by monitoring observable discrepancies (CWE-203)
    in a covert channel [REF-1400]. Predictor state may be shared when the processor
    transitions from one component to another (for example, when a process makes a
    system call to enter the kernel). Many commodity processors have features which
    prevent microarchitectural predictions that occur before a boundary from influencing
    predictions that occur after the boundary. Predictor state may also be shared
    between hardware threads, for example, sibling hardware threads on a processor
    that supports simultaneous multithreading (SMT). This sharing may be benign if
    the hardware threads are simultaneously executing in the same software component,
    or it could expose a weakness if one sibling is a malicious software component,
    and the other sibling is a victim software component. Processors that share microarchitectural
    predictors between hardware threads may have features which prevent microarchitectural
    predictions that occur on one hardware thread from influencing predictions that
    occur on another hardware thread. Features that restrict predictor state sharing
    across transitions or between hardware threads may be always-on, on by default,
    or may require opt-in from software.

  name: Improper Validation of Generative AI Output
  description: The product invokes a generative AI/ML component whose behaviors and

CWE-1427:
  name: Improper Neutralization of Input Used for LLM Prompting
  description: When prompts are constructed using externally controllable data, it
    is often possible to cause an LLM to ignore the original guidance provided by
    its creators (known as the system prompt) by inserting malicious instructions
    in plain human language or using bypasses such as special characters or tags.
    Because LLMs are designed to treat all instructions as legitimate, there is often
    no way for the model to differentiate between what prompt language is malicious
    when it performs inference and returns data. Many LLM systems incorporate data
    from other adjacent products or external data sources like Wikipedia using API
    calls and retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Any external sources in use that
    may contain untrusted data should also be considered potentially malicious.

CWE-1429:
  name: Missing Security-Relevant Feedback for Unexecuted Operations in Hardware Interface
  description: 'While some systems intentionally withhold feedback as a security measure,
    this approach must be strictly controlled to ensure it does not obscure operational
    failures that require prompt detection and remediation. Without these essential
    confirmations, failures go undetected, increasing the risk of data loss, security
    vulnerabilities, and overall system instability. Even when withholding feedback
    is an intentional part of a security policy designed, for example, to prevent
    attackers from gleaning sensitive internal details, the absence of expected feedback
    becomes a critical weakness when it masks operational failures that require prompt
    detection and remediation. For instance, certain encryption algorithms always
    return ciphertext regardless of errors to prevent attackers from gaining insight
    into internal state details. However, if such an algorithm fails to generate the
    expected ciphertext and provides no error feedback, the system cannot distinguish
    between a legitimate output and a malfunction. This can lead to undetected cryptographic
    failures, potentially compromising data security and system reliability. Without
    proper notification, a critical failure might remain hidden, undermining both
    the reliability and security of the process. Therefore, this weakness captures
    issues across various hardware interfaces where operations are discarded without
    any feedback, error handling, or logging. Such omissions can lead to data loss,
    security vulnerabilities, and system instability, with potential impacts ranging
    from minor to catastrophic. For some kinds of hardware products, some errors may
    be correctly identified and subsequently discarded, and the lack of feedback may
    have been an intentional design decision. However, this could result in a weakness
    if system operators or other authorized entities are not provided feedback about
    security-critical operations or failures that could prevent the operators from
    detecting and responding to an attack. For example: In a System-on-Chip (SoC)
    platform, write operations to reserved memory addresses might be correctly identified
    as invalid and subsequently discarded. However, if no feedback is provided to
    system operators, they may misinterpret the device''s state, failing to recognize
    conditions that could lead to broader failures or security vulnerabilities. For
    example, if an attacker attempts unauthorized writes to protected regions, the
    system may silently discard these writes without alerting security mechanisms.
    This lack of feedback could obscure intrusion attempts or misconfigurations, increasing
    the risk of unnoticed system compromise Microcontroller Interrupt Systems: When
    interrupts are silently ignored due to priority conflicts or internal errors without
    notifying higher-level control, it becomes challenging to diagnose system failures
    or detect potential security breaches in a timely manner. Network Interface Controllers:
    Dropping packets - perhaps due to buffer overflows - without any error feedback
    can not only cause data loss but may also contribute to exploitable timing discrepancies
